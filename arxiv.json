        "summary": "The rise of machine learning (ML) systems has exacerbated their carbon\nfootprint due to increased capabilities and model sizes. However, there is\nscarce knowledge on how the carbon footprint of ML models is actually measured,\nreported, and evaluated. In light of this, the paper aims to analyze the\nmeasurement of the carbon footprint of 1,417 ML models and associated datasets\non Hugging Face, which is the most popular repository for pretrained ML models.\nThe goal is to provide insights and recommendations on how to report and\noptimize the carbon efficiency of ML models. The study includes the first\nrepository mining study on the Hugging Face Hub API on carbon emissions. This\nstudy seeks to answer two research questions: (1) how do ML model creators\nmeasure and report carbon emissions on Hugging Face Hub?, and (2) what aspects\nimpact the carbon emissions of training ML models? The study yielded several\nkey findings. These include a decreasing proportion of carbon\nemissions-reporting models, a slight decrease in reported carbon footprint on\nHugging Face over the past 2 years, and a continued dominance of NLP as the\nmain application domain. Furthermore, the study uncovers correlations between\ncarbon emissions and various attributes such as model size, dataset size, and\nML application domains. These results highlight the need for software\nmeasurements to improve energy reporting practices and promote carbon-efficient\nmodel development within the Hugging Face community. In response to this issue,\ntwo classifications are proposed: one for categorizing models based on their\ncarbon emission reporting practices and another for their carbon efficiency.\nThe aim of these classification proposals is to foster transparency and\nsustainable model development within the ML community.",

        "summary": "Recently, model-based retrieval has emerged as a new paradigm in text\nretrieval that discards the index in the traditional retrieval model and\ninstead memorizes the candidate corpora using model parameters. This design\nemploys a sequence-to-sequence paradigm to generate document identifiers, which\nenables the complete capture of the relevance between queries and documents and\nsimplifies the classic indexretrieval-rerank pipeline. Despite its attractive\nqualities, there remain several major challenges in model-based retrieval,\nincluding the discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning, and the\ndiscrepancy between training and inference. To deal with the above challenges,\nwe propose a novel two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME, which\nmakes two major technical contributions, including the utilization of tokenized\nURLs as identifiers and the design of a two-stage generation architecture. We\nalso propose a number of training strategies to deal with the training\ndifficulty as the corpus size increases.

        "summary": "People usually have different intents for choosing items, while their\npreferences under the same intent may also different. In traditional\ncollaborative filtering approaches, both intent and preference factors are\nusually entangled in the modeling process, which significantly limits the\nrobustness and interpretability of recommendation performances. For example,\nthe low-rating items are always treated as negative feedback while they\nactually could provide positive information about user intent. To this end, in\nthis paper, we propose a two-fold representation learning approach, namely\nDouble Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (DDCF), for personalized\nrecommendations. The first-level disentanglement is for separating the\ninfluence factors of intent and preference, while the second-level\ndisentanglement is performed to build independent sparse preference\nrepresentations under individual intent with limited computational complexity.\nSpecifically, we employ two variational autoencoder networks, intent\nrecognition network and preference decomposition network, to learn the intent\nand preference factors, respectively. In this way, the low-rating items will be\ntreated as positive samples for modeling intents while the negative samples for\nmodeling preferences. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets and four evaluation metrics clearly validate the effectiveness and the\ninterpretability of DDCF.",

However, existing RL\nrecommendation methods encounter difficulties (i) to estimate the value\nfunctions for states which are not contained in the offline training data, and\n(ii) to learn effective state representations from user implicit feedback due\nto the lack of contrastive signals.

        "summary": "Dense retrieval has shown promise in the first-stage retrieval process when\ntrained on in-domain labeled datasets. However, previous studies have found\nthat dense retrieval is hard to generalize to unseen domains due to its weak\nmodeling of domain-invariant and interpretable feature (i.e., matching signal\nbetween two texts, which is the essence of information retrieval). In this\npaper, we propose a novel method to improve the generalization of dense\nretrieval via capturing matching signal called BERM. Fully fine-grained\nexpression and query-oriented saliency are two properties of the matching\nsignal. Thus, in BERM, a single passage is segmented into multiple units and\ntwo unit-level requirements are proposed for representation as the constraint\nin training to obtain the effective matching signal. One is semantic unit\nbalance and the other is essential matching unit extractability. Unit-level\nview and balanced semantics make representation express the text in a\nfine-grained manner. Essential matching unit extractability makes passage\nrepresentation sensitive to the given query to extract the pure matching\ninformation from the passage containing complex context. Experiments on BEIR\nshow that our method can be effectively combined with different dense retrieval\ntraining methods (vanilla, hard negatives mining and knowledge distillation) to\nimprove its generalization ability without any additional inference overhead\nand target domain data.",

        "summary": "Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to\nrecommender systems as an effective collaborative filtering (CF) approach. The\nkey idea of GNN-based recommender system is to recursively perform the message\npassing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded\nembeddings, relying on sufficient and high-quality training data. Since user\nbehavior data in practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits\nskewed distribution, some recommendation approaches, e.g., SGL and SimGCL,\nleverage self-supervised learning to improve user representations against the\nabove issues. Despite their effectiveness, however, they conduct\nself-supervised learning through creating contrastvie views, depending on the\nexploration of data augmentations with the problem of tedious trial-and-error\nselection of augmentation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive\nGraph Contrastive Learning (AdaptiveGCL) framework which conducts graph\ncontrastive learning with two adaptive contrastive view generators to better\nempower CF paradigm. Specifically, we use two trainable view generators, which\nare a graph generative model and a graph denoising model respectively, to\ncreate contrastive views. Two generators are able to create adaptive\ncontrastive views, addressing the problem of model collapse and achieving\nadaptive contrastive learning. With two adaptive contrasive views, more\nadditionally high-quality training signals will be introduced into the CF\nparadigm and help to alleviate the data sparsity and noise issues. Extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\nmodel over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further visual\nanalysis intuitively explains why our AdaptiveGCL outperforms existing\ncontrastive learning approaches based on selected data augmentation methods.",

The re-ranker generally produces better candidate scores\nthan the retriever, but is limited to seeing only the top K retrieved\ncandidates, thus providing no improvements in retrieval performance as measured\nby Recall@K. In this work, we leverage the re-ranker to also improve retrieval\nby providing inference-time relevance feedback to the retriever. Concretely, we\nupdate the retriever's query representation for a test instance using a\nlightweight inference-time distillation of the re-ranker's prediction for that\ninstance. The distillation loss is designed to bring the retriever's candidate\nscores closer to those of the re-ranker. A second retrieval step is then\nperformed with the updated query vector.

However, there is still much to be learned about how\nwell LLMs understand structured data, such as tables. While it is true that\ntables can be used as inputs to LLMs with serialization, there lack\ncomprehensive studies examining whether LLMs can truly comprehend such data. In\nthis paper we try to understand this by designing a benchmark to evaluate\nstructural understanding capabilities (SUC) of LLMs. The benchmark we create\nincludes seven tasks, each with their own unique challenges, e.g,, cell lookup,\nrow retrieval and size detection. We run a series of evaluations on GPT-3\nfamily models (e.g., text-davinci-003). We discover that the performance varied\ndepending on a number of input choices, including table input format, content\norder, role prompting and partition marks. Drawing from the insights gained\nthrough the benchmark evaluations, we then propose self-augmentation for\neffective structural prompting, e.g., critical value / range identification\nusing LLMs' internal knowledge. When combined with carefully chosen input\nchoices, these structural prompting methods lead to promising improvements in\nLLM performance on a variety of tabular tasks, e.g., TabFact($\\uparrow2.31\\%$),\nHybridQA($\\uparrow2.13\\%$), SQA($\\uparrow2.72\\%$), Feverous($\\uparrow0.84\\%$),\nand ToTTo($\\uparrow5.68\\%$).

To address the problems, we propose a novel\nGraIL-based inductive relation reasoning model, termed MINES, by introducing a\nMessage Intercommunication mechanism on the Neighbor-Enhanced Subgraph.\nConcretely, the message intercommunication mechanism is designed to capture the\nomitted hidden mutual information.

The success of few-shot semantic\nsegmentation in 2D computer vision is mainly driven by the pre-training on\nlarge-scale datasets like imagenet. The feature extractor pre-trained on\nlarge-scale 2D datasets greatly helps the 2D few-shot learning. However, the\ndevelopment of 3D deep learning is hindered by the limited volume and instance\nmodality of datasets due to the significant cost of 3D data collection and\nannotation. This results in less representative features and large intra-class\nfeature variation for few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation. As a consequence,\ndirectly extending existing popular prototypical methods of 2D few-shot\nclassification/segmentation into 3D point cloud segmentation won't work as well\nas in 2D domain. To address this issue, we propose a Query-Guided Prototype\nAdaption (QGPA) module to adapt the prototype from support point clouds feature\nspace to query point clouds feature space. With such prototype adaption, we\ngreatly alleviate the issue of large feature intra-class variation in point\ncloud and significantly improve the performance of few-shot 3D segmentation.\nBesides, to enhance the representation of prototypes, we introduce a\nSelf-Reconstruction (SR) module that enables prototype to reconstruct the\nsupport mask as well as possible.

        "summary": "Young children develop sophisticated internal models of the world based on\ntheir egocentric visual experience. How much of this is driven by innate\nconstraints and how much is driven by their experience? To investigate these\nquestions, we train state-of-the-art neural networks on a realistic proxy of a\nchild's visual experience without any explicit supervision or domain-specific\ninductive biases. Specifically, we train both embedding models and generative\nmodels on 200 hours of headcam video from a single child collected over two\nyears. We train a total of 72 different models, exploring a range of model\narchitectures and self-supervised learning algorithms, and comprehensively\nevaluate their performance in downstream tasks. The best embedding models\nperform at 70% of a highly performant ImageNet-trained model on average. They\nalso learn broad semantic categories without any labeled examples and learn to\nlocalize semantic categories in an image without any location supervision.\nHowever, these models are less object-centric and more background-sensitive\nthan comparable ImageNet-trained models. Generative models trained with the\nsame data successfully extrapolate simple properties of partially masked\nobjects, such as their texture, color, orientation, and rough outline, but\nstruggle with finer object details. We replicate our experiments with two other\nchildren and find very similar results. Broadly useful high-level visual\nrepresentations are thus robustly learnable from a representative sample of a\nchild's visual experience without strong inductive biases.",

Moreover, thanks to some dedicated adapter designs, Uni-ControlNet\nonly necessitates a constant number (i.e., 2) of adapters, regardless of the\nnumber of local or global controls used. This not only reduces the fine-tuning\ncosts and model size, making it more suitable for real-world deployment, but\nalso facilitate composability of different conditions.

        "summary": "Text-to-image model personalization aims to introduce a user-provided concept\nto the model, allowing its synthesis in diverse contexts. However, current\nmethods primarily focus on the case of learning a single concept from multiple\nimages with variations in backgrounds and poses, and struggle when adapted to a\ndifferent scenario. In this work, we introduce the task of textual scene\ndecomposition: given a single image of a scene that may contain several\nconcepts, we aim to extract a distinct text token for each concept, enabling\nfine-grained control over the generated scenes. To this end, we propose\naugmenting the input image with masks that indicate the presence of target\nconcepts. These masks can be provided by the user or generated automatically by\na pre-trained segmentation model. We then present a novel two-phase\ncustomization process that optimizes a set of dedicated textual embeddings\n(handles), as well as the model weights, striking a delicate balance between\naccurately capturing the concepts and avoiding overfitting. We employ a masked\ndiffusion loss to enable handles to generate their assigned concepts,\ncomplemented by a novel loss on cross-attention maps to prevent entanglement.\nWe also introduce union-sampling, a training strategy aimed to improve the\nability of combining multiple concepts in generated images. We use several\nautomatic metrics to quantitatively compare our method against several\nbaselines, and further affirm the results using a user study. Finally, we\nshowcase several applications of our method. Project page is available at:\nhttps://omriavrahami.com/break-a-scene/",

        "summary": "Text-to-image generation has recently witnessed remarkable achievements. We\nintroduce a text-conditional image diffusion model, termed RAPHAEL, to generate\nhighly artistic images, which accurately portray the text prompts, encompassing\nmultiple nouns, adjectives, and verbs. This is achieved by stacking tens of\nmixture-of-experts (MoEs) layers, i.e., space-MoE and time-MoE layers, enabling\nbillions of diffusion paths (routes) from the network input to the output. Each\npath intuitively functions as a \"painter\" for depicting a particular textual\nconcept onto a specified image region at a diffusion timestep. Comprehensive\nexperiments reveal that RAPHAEL outperforms recent cutting-edge models, such as\nStable Diffusion, ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, DeepFloyd, and DALL-E 2, in terms of both\nimage quality and aesthetic appeal. Firstly, RAPHAEL exhibits superior\nperformance in switching images across diverse styles, such as Japanese comics,\nrealism, cyberpunk, and ink illustration. Secondly, a single model with three\nbillion parameters, trained on 1,000 A100 GPUs for two months, achieves a\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot FID score of 6.61 on the COCO dataset. Furthermore,\nRAPHAEL significantly surpasses its counterparts in human evaluation on the\nViLG-300 benchmark. We believe that RAPHAEL holds the potential to propel the\nfrontiers of image generation research in both academia and industry, paving\nthe way for future breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.

        "summary": "This paper presents a method that can quickly adapt dynamic 3D avatars to\narbitrary text descriptions of novel styles. Among existing approaches for\navatar stylization, direct optimization methods can produce excellent results\nfor arbitrary styles but they are unpleasantly slow. Furthermore, they require\nredoing the optimization process from scratch for every new input. Fast\napproximation methods using feed-forward networks trained on a large dataset of\nstyle images can generate results for new inputs quickly, but tend not to\ngeneralize well to novel styles and fall short in quality. We therefore\ninvestigate a new approach, AlteredAvatar, that combines those two approaches\nusing the meta-learning framework. In the inner loop, the model learns to\noptimize to match a single target style well; while in the outer loop, the\nmodel learns to stylize efficiently across many styles. After training,\nAlteredAvatar learns an initialization that can quickly adapt within a small\nnumber of update steps to a novel style, which can be given using texts, a\nreference image, or a combination of both.

The core issue for learning feature matching is to how to learn (1)\ndiscriminative representations for feature points (or regions) within each\nintra-image and (2) consensus representations for feature points across\ninter-images. Recently, self- and cross-attention models have been exploited to\naddress this issue. However, in many scenes, features are coming with\nlarge-scale, redundant and outliers contaminated. Previous\nself-/cross-attention models generally conduct message passing on all primal\nfeatures which thus lead to redundant learning and high computational cost. To\nmitigate limitations, inspired by recent seed matching methods, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel efficient Anchor Matching Transformer (AMatFormer) for the\nfeature matching problem. AMatFormer has two main aspects: First, it mainly\nconducts self-/cross-attention on some anchor features and leverages these\nanchor features as message bottleneck to learn the representations for all\nprimal features. Thus, it can be implemented efficiently and compactly. Second,\nAMatFormer adopts a shared FFN module to further embed the features of two\nimages into the common domain and thus learn the consensus feature\nrepresentations for the matching problem.

As the result,\nTL;DR enables us to reduce the large dataset into a small set of high-quality\ndata, which can serve as an alternative pre-training dataset. This algorithm\nsignificantly speeds up the time-consuming pretraining process. Specifically,\nTL;DR can compress the mainstream VLP datasets at a high ratio, e.g., reduce\nwell-cleaned CC3M dataset from 2.82M to 0.67M ($\\sim$24\\%) and noisy YFCC15M\nfrom 15M to 2.5M ($\\sim$16.7\\%). Extensive experiments with three popular VLP\nmodels over seven downstream tasks show that VLP model trained on the\ncompressed dataset provided by TL;DR can perform similar or even better results\ncompared with training on the full-scale dataset.

With solely synthetic images, the\nrepresentations learned by StableRep surpass the performance of representations\nlearned by SimCLR and CLIP using the same set of text prompts and corresponding\nreal images, on large scale datasets. When we further add language supervision,\nStableRep trained with 20M synthetic images achieves better accuracy than CLIP\ntrained with 50M real images.",

        "summary": "We propose a novel algorithm called Unique Brain Network Identification\nNumber (UBNIN) for encoding brain networks of individual subject. To realize\nthis objective, we employed T1-weighted structural MRI of 180 Parkinson's\ndisease (PD) patients from National Institute of Mental Health and\nNeurosciences, India. We parcellated each subject's brain volume and\nconstructed individual adjacency matrix using correlation between grey matter\n(GM) volume of every pair of regions. The unique code is derived from values\nrepresenting connections of every node (i), weighted by a factor of 2^-(i-1).\nThe numerical representation UBNIN was observed to be distinct for each\nindividual brain network, which may also be applied to other neuroimaging\nmodalities. This model may be implemented as neural signature of a person's\nunique brain connectivity, thereby useful for brainprinting applications.\nAdditionally, we segregated the above dataset into five age-cohorts:\nA:22-32years, B:33-42years, C:43-52years, D:53-62years and E:63-72years to\nstudy the variation in network topology over age. Sparsity was adopted as the\nthreshold estimate to binarize each age-based correlation matrix. Connectivity\nmetrics were obtained using Brain Connectivity toolbox-based MATLAB functions.\nFor each age-cohort, a decreasing trend was observed in mean clustering\ncoefficient with increasing sparsity. Significantly different clustering\ncoefficient was noted between age-cohort B and C (sparsity: 0.63,0.66), C and E\n(sparsity: 0.66,0.69). Our findings suggest network connectivity patterns\nchange with age, indicating network disruption due to the underlying\nneuropathology. Varying clustering coefficient for different cohorts indicate\nthat information transfer between neighboring nodes change with age. This\nprovides evidence on age-related brain shrinkage and network degeneration.",

        "summary": "This work proposes a Momentum-Enabled Kronecker-Factor-Based Optimizer Using\nRank-1 updates, called MKOR, that improves the training time and convergence\nproperties of deep neural networks (DNNs). Second-order techniques, while\nenjoying higher convergence rates vs first-order counterparts, have cubic\ncomplexity with respect to either the model size and/or the training batch\nsize. Hence they exhibit poor scalability and performance in transformer\nmodels, e.g. large language models (LLMs), because the batch sizes in these\nmodels scale by the attention mechanism sequence length, leading to large model\nsize and batch sizes. MKOR's complexity is quadratic with respect to the model\nsize, alleviating the computation bottlenecks in second-order methods. Because\nof their high computation complexity, state-of-the-art implementations of\nsecond-order methods can only afford to update the second order information\ninfrequently, and thus do not fully exploit the promise of better convergence\nfrom these updates. By reducing the communication complexity of the\nsecond-order updates as well as achieving a linear communication complexity,\nMKOR increases the frequency of second order updates. We also propose a hybrid\nversion of MKOR (called MKOR-H) that mid-training falls backs to a first order\noptimizer if the second order updates no longer accelerate convergence. Our\nexperiments show that MKOR outperforms state -of-the-art first order methods,\ne.g. the LAMB optimizer, and best implementations of second-order methods, i.e.\nKAISA/KFAC, up to 2.57x and 1.85x respectively on BERT-Large-Uncased on 64\nGPUs.",

Because the identification of such ROIs has typically\nrelied on manually assembled stimulus sets consisting of isolated objects in\nnon-ecological contexts, exploring functional organization without robust a\npriori hypotheses has been challenging. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce a data-driven approach in which we synthesize images predicted to\nactivate a given brain region using paired natural images and fMRI recordings,\nbypassing the need for category-specific stimuli. Our approach -- Brain\nDiffusion for Visual Exploration (\"BrainDiVE\") -- builds on recent generative\nmethods by combining large-scale diffusion models with brain-guided image\nsynthesis. Validating our method, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize\npreferred images with appropriate semantic specificity for well-characterized\ncategory-selective ROIs. We then show that BrainDiVE can characterize\ndifferences between ROIs selective for the same high-level category.

        "summary": "StableDiffusion is a revolutionary text-to-image generator that is causing a\nstir in the world of image generation and editing. Unlike traditional methods\nthat learn a diffusion model in pixel space, StableDiffusion learns a diffusion\nmodel in the latent space via a VQGAN, ensuring both efficiency and quality. It\nnot only supports image generation tasks, but also enables image editing for\nreal images, such as image inpainting and local editing. However, we have\nobserved that the vanilla VQGAN used in StableDiffusion leads to significant\ninformation loss, causing distortion artifacts even in non-edited image\nregions. To this end, we propose a new asymmetric VQGAN with two simple\ndesigns. Firstly, in addition to the input from the encoder, the decoder\ncontains a conditional branch that incorporates information from task-specific\npriors, such as the unmasked image region in inpainting. Secondly, the decoder\nis much heavier than the encoder, allowing for more detailed recovery while\nonly slightly increasing the total inference cost. The training cost of our\nasymmetric VQGAN is cheap, and we only need to retrain a new asymmetric decoder\nwhile keeping the vanilla VQGAN encoder and StableDiffusion unchanged. Our\nasymmetric VQGAN can be widely used in StableDiffusion-based inpainting and\nlocal editing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can\nsignificantly improve the inpainting and editing performance, while maintaining\nthe original text-to-image capability.

The first challenge is\nto avoid biasing the pseudo-labels towards an incorrect distribution, such as\nthat of the labeled data or a balanced distribution, during training. However,\nwe still wish to ensure a balanced unlabeled distribution during inference,\nwhich is the second challenge. To address both of these challenges, we propose\na three-faceted solution: a flexible distribution alignment that progressively\naligns the classifier from a dynamically estimated unlabeled prior towards a\nbalanced distribution, a soft consistency regularization that exploits\nunderconfident pseudo-labels discarded by threshold-based methods, and a schema\nfor expanding the unlabeled set with input data from the labeled partition.\nThis last facet comes in as a response to the commonly-overlooked fact that\ndisjoint partitions of labeled and unlabeled data prevent the benefits of\nstrong data augmentation on the labeled set.

        "summary": "Image recognition and generation have long been developed independently of\neach other. With the recent trend towards general-purpose representation\nlearning, the development of general representations for both recognition and\ngeneration tasks is also promoted. However, preliminary attempts mainly focus\non generation performance, but are still inferior on recognition tasks. These\nmethods are modeled in the vector-quantized (VQ) space, whereas leading\nrecognition methods use pixels as inputs. Our key insights are twofold: (1)\npixels as inputs are crucial for recognition tasks; (2) VQ tokens as\nreconstruction targets are beneficial for generation tasks. These observations\nmotivate us to propose an Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process (ADDP) that\nintegrates these two spaces within a single representation learning framework.\nIn each denoising step, our method first decodes pixels from previous VQ\ntokens, then generates new VQ tokens from the decoded pixels. The diffusion\nprocess gradually masks out a portion of VQ tokens to construct the training\nsamples. The learned representations can be used to generate diverse\nhigh-fidelity images and also demonstrate excellent transfer performance on\nrecognition tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves\ncompetitive performance on unconditional generation, ImageNet classification,\nCOCO detection, and ADE20k segmentation. Importantly, our method represents the\nfirst successful development of general representations applicable to both\ngeneration and dense recognition tasks. Code shall be released.",

Thereby, rendering artifacts are repaired directly in\nthe underlying 3D representation by imposing multi-view path rendering\nconstraints. In addition, we condition a generator with multi-resolution NeRF\nrenderings which is adversarially trained to further improve rendering quality.\nWe demonstrate that our approach significantly improves rendering quality,\ne.g., nearly halving LPIPS scores compared to Nerfacto while at the same time\nimproving PSNR by 1.4dB on the advanced indoor scenes of Tanks and Temples.",

        "summary": "The latest breakthroughs in large vision-language models, such as Bard and\nGPT-4, have showcased extraordinary abilities in performing a wide range of\ntasks. Such models are trained on massive datasets comprising billions of\npublic image-text pairs with diverse tasks. However, their performance on\ntask-specific domains, such as radiology, is still under-investigated and\npotentially limited due to a lack of sophistication in understanding biomedical\nimages. On the other hand, conversational medical models have exhibited\nremarkable success but have mainly focused on text-based analysis. In this\npaper, we introduce XrayGPT, a novel conversational medical vision-language\nmodel that can analyze and answer open-ended questions about chest radiographs.\nSpecifically, we align both medical visual encoder (MedClip) with a fine-tuned\nlarge language model (Vicuna), using a simple linear transformation. This\nalignment enables our model to possess exceptional visual conversation\nabilities, grounded in a deep understanding of radiographs and medical domain\nknowledge. To enhance the performance of LLMs in the medical context, we\ngenerate ~217k interactive and high-quality summaries from free-text radiology\nreports. These summaries serve to enhance the performance of LLMs through the\nfine-tuning process. Our approach opens up new avenues the research for\nadvancing the automated analysis of chest radiographs.

This contrasts with most\nrepresentation learning methods, supervised or self-supervised, which learn a\nfixed embedding function and hence implicitly assume a single notion of\nsimilarity. For instance, models trained on ImageNet are biased towards object\ncategories, while a user might prefer the model to focus on colors, textures or\nspecific elements in the scene. In this paper, we propose the GeneCIS\n('genesis') benchmark, which measures models' ability to adapt to a range of\nsimilarity conditions. Extending prior work, our benchmark is designed for\nzero-shot evaluation only, and hence considers an open-set of similarity\nconditions. We find that baselines from powerful CLIP models struggle on\nGeneCIS and that performance on the benchmark is only weakly correlated with\nImageNet accuracy, suggesting that simply scaling existing methods is not\nfruitful. We further propose a simple, scalable solution based on automatically\nmining information from existing image-caption datasets. We find our method\noffers a substantial boost over the baselines on GeneCIS, and further improves\nzero-shot performance on related image retrieval benchmarks.

Second,\nscene-level temporal changes are often discrete and sporadic over time, rather\nthan continuous. To tackle these problems, we propose a new scene\nrepresentation equipped with a novel temporal step function encoding method\nthat can model discrete scene-level content changes as piece-wise constant\nfunctions over time. Specifically, we represent the scene as a space-time\nradiance field with a per-image illumination embedding, where\ntemporally-varying scene changes are encoded using a set of learned step\nfunctions. To facilitate our task of chronology reconstruction from Internet\nimagery, we also collect a new dataset of four scenes that exhibit various\nchanges over time.

A DP arrangement provides two views in a single shot,\nthus resembling a stereo image pair with a tiny baseline. However, the\ndifferent point spread function (PSF) per view, as well as the small disparity\nrange, makes the use of typical stereo matching algorithms problematic. To\naddress the above shortcomings, we propose a Continuous Cost Aggregation (CCA)\nscheme within a semi-global matching framework that is able to provide accurate\ncontinuous disparities from DP images. The proposed algorithm fits parabolas to\nmatching costs and aggregates parabola coefficients along image paths. The\naggregation step is performed subject to a quadratic constraint that not only\nenforces the disparity smoothness but also maintains the quadratic form of the\ntotal costs. This gives rise to an inherently efficient disparity propagation\nscheme with a pixel-wise minimization in closed-form.

In this work, we\nintroduce Seal, a novel framework that harnesses VFMs for segmenting diverse\nautomotive point cloud sequences.

Extensive experiments conducted on eleven different point cloud\ndatasets showcase the effectiveness and superiority of Seal.

        "summary": "The ability of generative models to produce highly realistic synthetic face\nimages has raised security and ethical concerns. As a first line of defense\nagainst such fake faces, deep learning based forensic classifiers have been\ndeveloped. While these forensic models can detect whether a face image is\nsynthetic or real with high accuracy, they are also vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. Although such attacks can be highly successful in evading detection by\nforensic classifiers, they introduce visible noise patterns that are detectable\nthrough careful human scrutiny. Additionally, these attacks assume access to\nthe target model(s) which may not always be true. Attempts have been made to\ndirectly perturb the latent space of GANs to produce adversarial fake faces\nthat can circumvent forensic classifiers. In this work, we go one step further\nand show that it is possible to successfully generate adversarial fake faces\nwith a specified set of attributes (e.g., hair color, eye size, race, gender,\netc.). To achieve this goal, we leverage the state-of-the-art generative model\nStyleGAN with disentangled representations, which enables a range of\nmodifications without leaving the manifold of natural images. We propose a\nframework to search for adversarial latent codes within the feature space of\nStyleGAN, where the search can be guided either by a text prompt or a reference\nimage. We also propose a meta-learning based optimization strategy to achieve\ntransferable performance on unknown target models. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach can produce semantically manipulated\nadversarial fake faces, which are true to the specified attribute set and can\nsuccessfully fool forensic face classifiers, while remaining undetectable by\nhumans.

Deep learning-based methods have significantly improved image\nrestoration performance, however, they have limited generalization ability to\ndifferent degradation types and levels. This restricts their real-world\napplication since it requires training individual models for each specific\ndegradation and knowing the input degradation type to apply the relevant model.\nWe present a prompt-based learning approach, PromptIR, for All-In-One image\nrestoration that can effectively restore images from various types and levels\nof degradation. In particular, our method uses prompts to encode\ndegradation-specific information, which is then used to dynamically guide the\nrestoration network. This allows our method to generalize to different\ndegradation types and levels, while still achieving state-of-the-art results on\nimage denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Overall, PromptIR offers a generic\nand efficient plugin module with few lightweight prompts that can be used to\nrestore images of various types and levels of degradation with no prior\ninformation on the corruptions present in the image.

However, most existing methods\nprimarily focus on tracking pedestrians or vehicles, which exhibit relatively\nsimple and regular motion patterns. Consequently, there is a scarcity of\nalgorithms that address the tracking of targets with irregular or non-linear\nmotion, such as multi-athlete tracking. Furthermore, popular tracking\nalgorithms often rely on the Kalman filter for object motion modeling, which\nfails to track objects when their motion contradicts the linear motion\nassumption of the Kalman filter. Due to this reason, we proposed a novel online\nand robust multi-object tracking approach, named Iterative Scale-Up\nExpansionIoU and Deep Features for multi-object tracking. Unlike conventional\nmethods, we abandon the use of the Kalman filter and propose utilizing the\niterative scale-up expansion IoU. This approach achieves superior tracking\nperformance without requiring additional training data or adopting a more\nrobust detector, all while maintaining a lower computational cost compared to\nother appearance-based methods.

However, manual detection of\nCMBs is a time-consuming and error-prone process because of their sparse and\ntiny structural properties. The detection of CMBs is commonly affected by the\npresence of many CMB mimics that cause a high false-positive rate (FPR), such\nas calcification and pial vessels. This paper proposes a novel 3D deep learning\nframework that does not only detect CMBs but also inform their anatomical\nlocation in the brain (i.e., lobar, deep, and infratentorial regions). For the\nCMB detection task, we propose a single end-to-end model by leveraging the\nU-Net as a backbone with Region Proposal Network (RPN). To significantly reduce\nthe FPs within the same single model, we develop a new scheme, containing\nFeature Fusion Module (FFM) that detects small candidates utilizing contextual\ninformation and Hard Sample Prototype Learning (HSPL) that mines CMB mimics and\ngenerates additional loss term called concentration loss using Convolutional\nPrototype Learning (CPL). The anatomical localization task does not only tell\nto which region the CMBs belong but also eliminate some FPs from the detection\ntask by utilizing anatomical information. The results show that the proposed\nRPN that utilizes the FFM and HSPL outperforms the vanilla RPN and achieves a\nsensitivity of 94.66% vs. 93.33% and an average number of false positives per\nsubject (FPavg) of 0.86 vs. 14.73.

To address those issues, we explore prompt learning in universal\narchitectures for image restoration tasks.

In\nsimulations, we find that a single RVT model works well across 18 RLBench tasks\nwith 249 task variations, achieving 26% higher relative success than the\nexisting state-of-the-art method (PerAct).

Our method anchors images of different domains to the same\nlatent space of frozen GANs by learning lightweight encoder and regressor\nmodels to reconstruct single-domain images.

While there has been great progress in physical\nand video prediction models in recent years, benchmarks to test their\nperformance typically do not require an understanding that objects have\nindividual physical properties, or at best test only those properties that are\ndirectly observable (e.g., size or color). This work proposes a novel dataset\nand benchmark, termed Physion++, that rigorously evaluates visual physical\nprediction in artificial systems under circumstances where those predictions\nrely on accurate estimates of the latent physical properties of objects in the\nscene. Specifically, we test scenarios where accurate prediction relies on\nestimates of properties such as mass, friction, elasticity, and deformability,\nand where the values of those properties can only be inferred by observing how\nobjects move and interact with other objects or fluids. We evaluate the\nperformance of a number of state-of-the-art prediction models that span a\nvariety of levels of learning vs. built-in knowledge, and compare that\nperformance to a set of human predictions. We find that models that have been\ntrained using standard regimes and datasets do not spontaneously learn to make\ninferences about latent properties, but also that models that encode objectness\nand physical states tend to make better predictions.

        "summary": "The increasing access to data poses both opportunities and risks in deep\nlearning, as one can manipulate the behaviors of deep learning models with\nmalicious training samples. Such attacks are known as data poisoning. Recent\nadvances in defense strategies against data poisoning have highlighted the\neffectiveness of aggregation schemes in achieving state-of-the-art results in\ncertified poisoning robustness. However, the practical implications of these\napproaches remain unclear. Here we focus on Deep Partition Aggregation, a\nrepresentative aggregation defense, and assess its practical aspects, including\nefficiency, performance, and robustness. For evaluations, we use ImageNet\nresized to a resolution of 64 by 64 to enable evaluations at a larger scale\nthan previous ones. Firstly, we demonstrate a simple yet practical approach to\nscaling base models, which improves the efficiency of training and inference\nfor aggregation defenses. Secondly, we provide empirical evidence supporting\nthe data-to-complexity ratio, i.e. the ratio between the data set size and\nsample complexity, as a practical estimation of the maximum number of base\nmodels that can be deployed while preserving accuracy. Last but not least, we\npoint out how aggregation defenses boost poisoning robustness empirically\nthrough the poisoning overfitting phenomenon, which is the key underlying\nmechanism for the empirical poisoning robustness of aggregations. Overall, our\nfindings provide valuable insights for practical implementations of aggregation\ndefenses to mitigate the threat of data poisoning.",

        "summary": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have significantly changed the computer vision\nlandscape and have periodically exhibited superior performance in vision tasks\ncompared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although the jury is still\nout on which model type is superior, each has unique inductive biases that\nshape their learning and generalization performance. For example, ViTs have\ninteresting properties with respect to early layer non-local feature\ndependence, as well as self-attention mechanisms which enhance learning\nflexibility, enabling them to ignore out-of-context image information more\neffectively. We hypothesize that this power to ignore out-of-context\ninformation (which we name $\\textit{patch selectivity}$), while integrating\nin-context information in a non-local manner in early layers, allows ViTs to\nmore easily handle occlusion. In this study, our aim is to see whether we can\nhave CNNs $\\textit{simulate}$ this ability of patch selectivity by effectively\nhardwiring this inductive bias using Patch Mixing data augmentation, which\nconsists of inserting patches from another image onto a training image and\ninterpolating labels between the two image classes. Specifically, we use Patch\nMixing to train state-of-the-art ViTs and CNNs, assessing its impact on their\nability to ignore out-of-context patches and handle natural occlusions. We find\nthat ViTs do not improve nor degrade when trained using Patch Mixing, but CNNs\nacquire new capabilities to ignore out-of-context information and improve on\nocclusion benchmarks, leaving us to conclude that this training method is a way\nof simulating in CNNs the abilities that ViTs already possess. We will release\nour Patch Mixing implementation and proposed datasets for public use. Project\npage: https://arielnlee.github.io/PatchMixing/",

Experimental results, carried out on three sets of the Shape COSEG\nDataset, on the human segmentation dataset proposed in Maron et al., 2017 and\non the ShapeNet benchmark, show how the proposed approach yields\nstate-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation of 3D meshes.",

However, their capacity\nfor planning and communication in multi-agent cooperation remains unclear, even\nthough these are crucial skills for intelligent embodied agents. In this paper,\nwe present a novel framework that utilizes LLMs for multi-agent cooperation and\ntests it in various embodied environments.

We demonstrate that recent LLMs,\nsuch as GPT-4, can surpass strong planning-based methods and exhibit emergent\neffective communication using our framework without requiring fine-tuning or\nfew-shot prompting. We also discover that LLM-based agents that communicate in\nnatural language can earn more trust and cooperate more effectively with\nhumans.

        "summary": "Large web-sourced multimodal datasets have powered a slew of new methods for\nlearning general-purpose visual representations, advancing the state of the art\nin computer vision and revolutionizing zero- and few-shot recognition. One\ncrucial decision facing practitioners is how, if at all, to curate these\never-larger datasets. For example, the creators of the LAION-5B dataset chose\nto retain only image-caption pairs whose CLIP similarity score exceeded a\ndesignated threshold. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art data\nfiltering approach motivated by our observation that nearly 40% of LAION's\nimages contain text that overlaps significantly with the caption. Intuitively,\nsuch data could be wasteful as it incentivizes models to perform optical\ncharacter recognition rather than learning visual features. However, naively\nremoving all such data could also be wasteful, as it throws away images that\ncontain visual features (in addition to overlapping text). Our simple and\nscalable approach, T-MARS (Text Masking and Re-Scoring), filters out only those\npairs where the text dominates the remaining visual features -- by first\nmasking out the text and then filtering out those with a low CLIP similarity\nscore of the masked image. Experimentally, T-MARS outperforms the top-ranked\nmethod on the \"medium scale\" of DataComp (a data filtering benchmark) by a\nmargin of 6.5% on ImageNet and 4.7% on VTAB. Additionally, our systematic\nevaluation on various data pool sizes from 2M to 64M shows that the accuracy\ngains enjoyed by T-MARS linearly increase as data and compute are scaled\nexponentially.

Acquiring unlabeled data for annotation requires a\ndelicate balance between avoiding outliers to conserve the annotation budget\nand prioritizing useful inlier examples for effective training. In this work,\nwe present an approach that leverages three highly synergistic components,\nwhich are identified as key ingredients: joint classifier training with inliers\nand outliers, semi-supervised learning through pseudo-labeling, and model\nensembling. Our work demonstrates that ensembling significantly enhances the\naccuracy of pseudo-labeling and improves the quality of data acquisition. By\nenabling semi-supervision through the joint training process, where outliers\nare properly handled, we observe a substantial boost in classifier accuracy\nthrough the use of all available unlabeled examples. Notably, we reveal that\nthe integration of joint training renders explicit outlier detection\nunnecessary; a conventional component for acquisition in prior work. The three\nkey components align seamlessly with numerous existing approaches. Through\nempirical evaluations, we showcase that their combined use leads to a\nperformance increase.

An ideal neural network architecture\nfor such tasks would leverage the fact that objects can be rotated and\ntranslated in three dimensions to make predictions about novel images. However,\nimposing SO(3)-equivariance on two-dimensional inputs is difficult because the\ngroup of three-dimensional rotations does not have a natural action on the\ntwo-dimensional plane. Specifically, it is possible that an element of SO(3)\nwill rotate an image out of plane. We show that an algorithm that learns a\nthree-dimensional representation of the world from two dimensional images must\nsatisfy certain geometric consistency properties which we formulate as\nSO(2)-equivariance constraints. We use the induced and restricted\nrepresentations of SO(2) on SO(3) to construct and classify architectures which\nsatisfy these geometric consistency constraints. We prove that any architecture\nwhich respects said consistency constraints can be realized as an instance of\nour construction. We show that three previously proposed neural architectures\nfor 3D pose prediction are special cases of our construction.

To\nimprove the artery segmentation accuracy and stability during scans, this work\npresents a novel pulsation-assisted segmentation neural network (PAS-NN) by\nexplicitly taking advantage of the cardiac-induced motions. Motion\nmagnification techniques are employed to amplify the subtle motion within the\nfrequency band of interest to extract the pulsation signals from sequential US\nimages. The extracted real-time pulsation information can help to locate the\narteries on cross-section US images; therefore, we explicitly integrated the\npulsation into the proposed PAS-NN as attention guidance. Notably, a robotic\narm is necessary to provide stable movement during US imaging since magnifying\nthe target motions from the US images captured along a scan path is not\nmanually feasible due to the hand tremor. To validate the proposed robotic US\nsystem for imaging arteries, experiments are carried out on volunteers' carotid\nand radial arteries.

Access to\nhigh-confidence labels, such as histology-based diagnoses, is rare and costly.\nPretraining strategies, like contrastive learning (CL) methods, can leverage\nunlabeled or weakly-annotated datasets. These methods typically require large\nbatch sizes, which poses a difficulty in the case of large 3D images at full\nresolution, due to limited GPU memory. Nevertheless, volumetric positional\ninformation about the spatial context of each 2D slice can be very important\nfor some medical applications. In this work, we propose an efficient\nweakly-supervised positional (WSP) contrastive learning strategy where we\nintegrate both the spatial context of each 2D slice and a weak label via a\ngeneric kernel-based loss function. We illustrate our method on cirrhosis\nprediction using a large volume of weakly-labeled images, namely radiological\nlow-confidence annotations, and small strongly-labeled (i.e., high-confidence)\ndatasets.

My3DGen can\nreconstruct multi-view consistent images from an input test image, and generate\nnovel appearances by interpolating between any two images of the same\nindividual. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of\npersonalized generative priors in producing high-quality 2D portrait\nreconstructions and syntheses, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first\nto develop a personalized 3D generative prior. Instead of fine-tuning a large\npre-trained generative model with millions of parameters to achieve\npersonalization, we propose a parameter-efficient approach. Our method involves\nutilizing a pre-trained model with fixed weights as a generic prior, while\ntraining a separate personalized prior through low-rank decomposition of the\nweights in each convolution and fully connected layer. However,\nparameter-efficient few-shot fine-tuning on its own often leads to overfitting.\nTo address this, we introduce a regularization technique based on symmetry of\nhuman faces. This regularization enforces that novel view renderings of a\ntraining sample, rendered from symmetric poses, exhibit the same identity. By\nincorporating this symmetry prior, we enhance the quality of reconstruction and\nsynthesis, particularly for non-frontal (profile) faces. Our final system\ncombines low-rank fine-tuning with symmetry regularization and significantly\nsurpasses the performance of pre-trained models, e.g. EG3D. It introduces only\napproximately 0.6 million additional parameters per identity compared to 31\nmillion for full finetuning of the original model. As a result, our system\nachieves a 50-fold reduction in model size without sacrificing the quality of\nthe generated 3D faces.

        "summary": "Recognizing interactive action plays an important role in human-robot\ninteraction and collaboration. Previous methods use late fusion and\nco-attention mechanism to capture interactive relations, which have limited\nlearning capability or inefficiency to adapt to more interacting entities. With\nassumption that priors of each entity are already known, they also lack\nevaluations on a more general setting addressing the diversity of subjects. To\naddress these problems, we propose an Interactive Spatiotemporal Token\nAttention Network (ISTA-Net), which simultaneously model spatial, temporal, and\ninteractive relations. Specifically, our network contains a tokenizer to\npartition Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens (ISTs), which is a unified way to\nrepresent motions of multiple diverse entities. By extending the entity\ndimension, ISTs provide better interactive representations. To jointly learn\nalong three dimensions in ISTs, multi-head self-attention blocks integrated\nwith 3D convolutions are designed to capture inter-token correlations. When\nmodeling correlations, a strict entity ordering is usually irrelevant for\nrecognizing interactive actions. To this end, Entity Rearrangement is proposed\nto eliminate the orderliness in ISTs for interchangeable entities. Extensive\nexperiments on four datasets verify the effectiveness of ISTA-Net by\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Necolizer/ISTA-Net",

Despite\nongoing advancements in terms of generation quality and realism, no methodical\nframeworks have been defined yet to quantitatively measure the quality of the\ngenerated content and the adherence with the prompted requests: so far, only\nhuman-based evaluations have been adopted for quality satisfaction and for\ncomparing different generative methods. We introduce a novel automated method\nfor Visual Concept Evaluation (ViCE), i.e. to assess consistency between a\ngenerated/edited image and the corresponding prompt/instructions, with a\nprocess inspired by the human cognitive behaviour. ViCE combines the strengths\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) into a\nunified pipeline, aiming to replicate the human cognitive process in quality\nassessment. This method outlines visual concepts, formulates image-specific\nverification questions, utilizes the Q&amp;A system to investigate the image, and\nscores the combined outcome. Although this brave new hypothesis of mimicking\nhumans in the image evaluation process is in its preliminary assessment stage,\nresults are promising and open the door to a new form of automatic evaluation\nwhich could have significant impact as the image generation or the image target\nediting tasks become more and more sophisticated.",

Most existing studies treat each sample equally and aim\nto reduce the average estimation error for the entire dataset, which can be\nsummarized as General Age Estimation. However, due to the long-tailed\ndistribution prevalent in the dataset, treating all samples equally will\ninevitably bias the model toward the head classes (usually the adult with a\nmajority of samples). Driven by this, some works suggest that each class should\nbe treated equally to improve performance in tail classes (with a minority of\nsamples), which can be summarized as Long-tailed Age Estimation. However,\nLong-tailed Age Estimation usually faces a performance trade-off, i.e.,\nachieving improvement in tail classes by sacrificing the head classes. In this\npaper, our goal is to design a unified framework to perform well on both tasks,\nkilling two birds with one stone.

While dominating on the COCO benchmark, recent Transformer-based\ndetection methods are not competitive in diverse domains. Moreover, these\nmethods still struggle to very accurately estimate the object bounding boxes in\ncomplex environments.\n  We introduce Cascade-DETR for high-quality universal object detection. We\njointly tackle the generalization to diverse domains and localization accuracy\nby proposing the Cascade Attention layer, which explicitly integrates\nobject-centric information into the detection decoder by limiting the attention\nto the previous box prediction. To further enhance accuracy, we also revisit\nthe scoring of queries. Instead of relying on classification scores, we predict\nthe expected IoU of the query, leading to substantially more well-calibrated\nconfidences. Lastly, we introduce a universal object detection benchmark,\nUDB10, that contains 10 datasets from diverse domains. While also advancing the\nstate-of-the-art on COCO, Cascade-DETR substantially improves DETR-based\ndetectors on all datasets in UDB10, even by over 10 mAP in some cases.

To accommodate active\nlearning and domain adaption, the two naturally different tasks, in a\ncollaborative framework, we advocate that a customized learning strategy for\nthe target data is the key to the success of ADA solutions.

The label dependency of these methods also limits their flexibility\nin learning more general skeleton representations. This paper proposes a\ngeneric unsupervised Hierarchical skeleton Meta-Prototype Contrastive learning\n(Hi-MPC) approach with Hard Skeleton Mining (HSM) for person re-ID with\nunlabeled 3D skeletons. Firstly, we construct hierarchical representations of\nskeletons to model coarse-to-fine body and motion features from the levels of\nbody joints, components, and limbs. Then a hierarchical meta-prototype\ncontrastive learning model is proposed to cluster and contrast the most typical\nskeleton features (\"prototypes\") from different-level skeletons.

        "summary": "The accelerated adoption of digital pathology and advances in deep learning\nhave enabled the development of powerful models for various pathology tasks\nacross a diverse array of diseases and patient cohorts. However, model training\nis often difficult due to label scarcity in the medical domain and the model's\nusage is limited by the specific task and disease for which it is trained.\nAdditionally, most models in histopathology leverage only image data, a stark\ncontrast to how humans teach each other and reason about histopathologic\nentities. We introduce CONtrastive learning from Captions for Histopathology\n(CONCH), a visual-language foundation model developed using diverse sources of\nhistopathology images, biomedical text, and notably over 1.17 million\nimage-caption pairs via task-agnostic pretraining. Evaluated on a suite of 13\ndiverse benchmarks, CONCH can be transferred to a wide range of downstream\ntasks involving either or both histopathology images and text, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on histology image classification, segmentation,\ncaptioning, text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval.

We leverage this observation to\nexpand the capabilities of NLOS imaging using illumination beyond the third\nbounce, addressing two problems: imaging single-corner objects at limited\nvisibility angles, and imaging objects hidden behind two corners. To image\nobjects at limited visibility angles, we first analyze the reflections of the\nknown illuminated point on surfaces of the scene as an estimator of the\nposition and orientation of objects with limited visibility.

        "summary": "The recent video grounding works attempt to introduce vanilla contrastive\nlearning into video grounding. However, we claim that this naive solution is\nsuboptimal. Contrastive learning requires two key properties: (1)\n\\emph{alignment} of features of similar samples, and (2) \\emph{uniformity} of\nthe induced distribution of the normalized features on the hypersphere. Due to\ntwo annoying issues in video grounding: (1) the co-existence of some visual\nentities in both ground truth and other moments, \\ie semantic overlapping; (2)\nonly a few moments in the video are annotated, \\ie sparse annotation dilemma,\nvanilla contrastive learning is unable to model the correlations between\ntemporally distant moments and learned inconsistent video representations. Both\ncharacteristics lead to vanilla contrastive learning being unsuitable for video\ngrounding. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic and Game Localization (G2L), a\nsemantically aligned and uniform video grounding framework via geodesic and\ngame theory. We quantify the correlations among moments leveraging the geodesic\ndistance that guides the model to learn the correct cross-modal\nrepresentations. Furthermore, from the novel perspective of game theory, we\npropose semantic Shapley interaction based on geodesic distance sampling to\nlearn fine-grained semantic alignment in similar moments.

Using our special formulation, we iteratively denoise a motion buffer\nthat contains a set of increasingly-noised poses, which auto-regressively\nproduces an arbitrarily long stream of frames.

Medical images are inherently\ndifferent from natural images as they are acquired in the form of many\nmodalities (CT, MR, PET, Ultrasound etc.) and contain granulated information\nlike tissue, lesion, organs etc. These characteristics of medical images\nrequire special attention towards learning features representative of local\ncontext. In this work, we focus on designing an effective pre-training\nframework for 3D radiology images. First, we propose a new masking strategy\ncalled local masking where the masking is performed across channel embeddings\ninstead of tokens to improve the learning of local feature representations. We\ncombine this with classical low-level perturbations like adding noise and\ndownsampling to further enable low-level representation learning. To this end,\nwe introduce Disruptive Autoencoders, a pre-training framework that attempts to\nreconstruct the original image from disruptions created by a combination of\nlocal masking and low-level perturbations. Additionally, we also devise a\ncross-modal contrastive loss (CMCL) to accommodate the pre-training of multiple\nmodalities in a single framework. We curate a large-scale dataset to enable\npre-training of 3D medical radiology images (MRI and CT).

However, with the exponential\ngrowth of model sizes, the conventional full fine-tuning, which needs to store\na individual network copy for each tasks, leads to increasingly huge storage\nand transmission overhead. Adapter-based Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PET)\nmethods address this challenge by tuning lightweight adapters inserted into the\nfrozen pre-trained models. In this paper, we investigate how to make adapters\neven more efficient, reaching a new minimum size required to store a\ntask-specific fine-tuned network. Inspired by the observation that the\nparameters of adapters converge at flat local minima, we find that adapters are\nresistant to noise in parameter space, which means they are also resistant to\nlow numerical precision. To train low-precision adapters, we propose a\ncomputational-efficient quantization method which minimizes the quantization\nerror. Through extensive experiments, we find that low-precision adapters\nexhibit minimal performance degradation, and even 1-bit precision is sufficient\nfor adapters. The experimental results demonstrate that 1-bit adapters\noutperform all other PET methods on both the VTAB-1K benchmark and few-shot\nFGVC tasks, while requiring the smallest storage size.

However, their vulnerability to the threat of\nadversarial perturbations should not be neglected. Unfortunately, current\nadversarial defense approaches in RS studies usually suffer from performance\nfluctuation and unnecessary re-training costs due to the need for prior\nknowledge of the adversarial perturbations among RS data. To circumvent these\nchallenges, we propose a universal adversarial defense approach in RS imagery\n(UAD-RS) using pre-trained diffusion models to defend the common DNNs against\nmultiple unknown adversarial attacks. Specifically, the generative diffusion\nmodels are first pre-trained on different RS datasets to learn generalized\nrepresentations in various data domains. After that, a universal adversarial\npurification framework is developed using the forward and reverse process of\nthe pre-trained diffusion models to purify the perturbations from adversarial\nsamples. Furthermore, an adaptive noise level selection (ANLS) mechanism is\nbuilt to capture the optimal noise level of the diffusion model that can\nachieve the best purification results closest to the clean samples according to\ntheir Frechet Inception Distance (FID) in deep feature space. As a result, only\na single pre-trained diffusion model is needed for the universal purification\nof adversarial samples on each dataset, which significantly alleviates the\nre-training efforts for each attack setting and maintains high performance\nwithout the prior knowledge of adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four\nheterogeneous RS datasets regarding scene classification and semantic\nsegmentation verify that UAD-RS outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial\npurification approaches with a universal defense against seven commonly\nexisting adversarial perturbations.",

For example, as a typical method for self-supervised\ndenoising, the original blind spot network (BSN) assumes that the noise is\npixel-wise independent, which is much different from the real cases.

        "summary": "Images are loaded with semantic information that pertains to real-world\nontologies: dog breeds share mammalian similarities, food pictures are often\ndepicted in domestic environments, and so on. However, when training machine\nlearning models for image classification, the relative similarities amongst\nobject classes are commonly paired with one-hot-encoded labels. According to\nthis logic, if an image is labelled as 'spoon', then 'tea-spoon' and 'shark'\nare equally wrong in terms of training loss. To overcome this limitation, we\nexplore the integration of additional goals that reflect ontological and\nsemantic knowledge, improving model interpretability and trustworthiness. We\nsuggest a generic approach that allows to derive an additional loss term\nstarting from any kind of semantic information about the classification label.\nFirst, we show how to apply our approach to ontologies and word embeddings, and\ndiscuss how the resulting information can drive a supervised learning process.\nSecond, we use our semantically enriched loss to train image classifiers, and\nanalyse the trade-offs between accuracy, mistake severity, and learned internal\nrepresentations. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be further exploited\nin terms of explainability and adversarial robustness. Code repository:\nhttps://github.com/S1M0N38/semantic-encodings",

However, how to fully leverage CLIP's\nunprecedented human-like understanding capabilities to achieve better zero-shot\nclassification is still an open question. This paper draws inspiration from the\nhuman visual perception process: a modern neuroscience view suggests that in\nclassifying an object, humans first infer its class-independent attributes\n(e.g., background and orientation) which help separate the foreground object\nfrom the background, and then make decisions based on this information.\nInspired by this, we observe that providing CLIP with contextual attributes\nimproves zero-shot classification and mitigates reliance on spurious features.\nWe also observe that CLIP itself can reasonably infer the attributes from an\nimage. With these observations, we propose a training-free, two-step zero-shot\nclassification method named PerceptionCLIP. Given an image, it first infers\ncontextual attributes (e.g., background) and then performs object\nclassification conditioning on them. Our experiments show that PerceptionCLIP\nachieves better generalization, group robustness, and better interpretability.\nFor example, PerceptionCLIP with ViT-L/14 improves the worst group accuracy by\n16.5% on the Waterbirds dataset and by 3.5% on CelebA.",

In this work, we take the initial step towards\nbridging the gap between the robustness of classification and object detection\nby leveraging adversarially trained classification models. Merely utilizing\nadversarially trained models as backbones for object detection does not result\nin robustness.

However, when a text stream\ndescribes a sequence of continuous motions, the generated motions corresponding\nto each sentence may not be coherently linked. Existing long-term motion\ngeneration methods face two main issues. Firstly, they cannot directly generate\ncoherent motions and require additional operations such as interpolation to\nprocess the generated actions. Secondly, they generate subsequent actions in an\nautoregressive manner without considering the influence of future actions on\nprevious ones. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that\nutilizes a past-conditioned diffusion model with two optional coherent sampling\nmethods: Past Inpainting Sampling and Compositional Transition Sampling. Past\nInpainting Sampling completes subsequent motions by treating previous motions\nas conditions, while Compositional Transition Sampling models the distribution\nof the transition as the composition of two adjacent motions guided by\ndifferent text prompts.

One way to address this\nchallenge is to leverage multi-modal models, such as CLIP, to provide image and\ntext features in a shared embedding space, which bridges the gap between\nclosed-vocabulary and open-vocabulary recognition. Hence, existing methods\noften adopt a two-stage framework to tackle the problem, where the inputs first\ngo through a mask generator and then through the CLIP model along with the\npredicted masks. This process involves extracting features from images multiple\ntimes, which can be ineffective and inefficient. By contrast, we propose to\nbuild everything into a single-stage framework using a shared Frozen\nConvolutional CLIP backbone, which not only significantly simplifies the\ncurrent two-stage pipeline, but also remarkably yields a better accuracy-cost\ntrade-off. The proposed FC-CLIP, benefits from the following observations: the\nfrozen CLIP backbone maintains the ability of open-vocabulary classification\nand can also serve as a strong mask generator, and the convolutional CLIP\ngeneralizes well to a larger input resolution than the one used during\ncontrastive image-text pretraining.

While the\npointwise volume-preserving constraint is effective for some problems, it is\ntoo stringent for many other problems especially when the local deformations\nare relatively large, because it may lead to a poor large-deformation for\nenforcing local matching.In this paper, we propose a novel bi-variant\ndiffeomorphic image registration model with the soft constraint of Jacobian\nequation, which allows local deformations to shrink and grow in a flexible\nrange.The Jacobian determinant of the transformation is explicitly controlled\nby optimizing the relaxation function. To prevent deformation folding and\nenhance the smoothness of deformation, we not only impose a positivity\nconstraint in optimizing the relaxation function, but also employ a regularizer\nto ensure the smoothness of the relaxation function.Furthermore, the positivity\nconstraint ensures that is as close to one as possible, which helps to obtain a\nvolume-preserving transformation on average.We further analyze the existence of\nthe minimizer for the variational model and propose a penalty splitting method\nwith a multilevel strategy to solve this model. Numerical experiments show that\nthe proposed algorithm is convergent, and the positivity constraint can control\nthe range of relative volume and not compromise registration accuracy.\nMoreover, the proposed model produces diffeomorphic maps for large deformation,\nand achieves better performance compared to the several existing registration\nmodels.",

Even so, these require training deep networks\nwith millions of parameters every time new data becomes available. A recently\npublished foundation model, Segment-Anything (SAM), generalizes well to a large\nvariety of natural images, hence tackling this challenge to a reasonable\nextent. However, SAM does not generalize well to the medical domain as is\nwithout utilizing a large amount of compute resources for fine-tuning and using\ntask-specific prompts. Moreover, these prompts are in the form of\nbounding-boxes or foreground/background points that need to be annotated\nexplicitly for every image, making this solution increasingly tedious with\nhigher data size. In this work, we propose AdaptiveSAM - an adaptive\nmodification of SAM that can adjust to new datasets quickly and efficiently,\nwhile enabling text-prompted segmentation. For finetuning AdaptiveSAM, we\npropose an approach called bias-tuning that requires a significantly smaller\nnumber of trainable parameters than SAM (less than 2\\%). At the same time,\nAdaptiveSAM requires negligible expert intervention since it uses free-form\ntext as prompt and can segment the object of interest with just the label name\nas prompt. Our experiments show that AdaptiveSAM outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods on various medical imaging datasets including surgery,\nultrasound and X-ray.

This\npaper discusses the challenge of achieving efficient computation in TSGV models\nwhile maintaining high performance. Most existing approaches exquisitely design\ncomplex architectures to improve accuracy with extra layers and loss, suffering\nfrom inefficiency and heaviness. Although some works have noticed that, they\nonly make an issue of feature fusion layers, which can hardly enjoy the\nhighspeed merit in the whole clunky network. To tackle this problem, we propose\na novel efficient multi-teacher model (EMTM) based on knowledge distillation to\ntransfer diverse knowledge from both heterogeneous and isomorphic networks.\nSpecifically, We first unify different outputs of the heterogeneous models into\none single form. Next, a Knowledge Aggregation Unit (KAU) is built to acquire\nhigh-quality integrated soft labels from multiple teachers. After that, the KAU\nmodule leverages the multi-scale video and global query information to\nadaptively determine the weights of different teachers. A Shared Encoder\nstrategy is then proposed to solve the problem that the student shallow layers\nhardly benefit from teachers, in which an isomorphic teacher is collaboratively\ntrained with the student to align their hidden states.

A\nscene-event mapping mechanism is first designed to bridge the gap between the\nunderlying scene structure and the high-level event semantic structure,\nresulting in an overall hierarchical scene-event (termed ICE) graph structure.\nWe further perform iterative structure refinement to optimize the ICE graph,\nsuch that the overall structure representation can best coincide with end task\ndemand. Finally, three subtask predictions of VidSRL are jointly decoded, where\nthe end-to-end paradigm effectively avoids error propagation. On the benchmark\ndataset, our framework boosts significantly over the current best-performing\nmodel. Further analyses are shown for a better understanding of the advances of\nour methods.",

In recent days, the\nmean-teacher approach trained with pseudo-labels and weak-strong augmentation\nconsistency is gaining popularity for semi-supervised object detection.\nHowever, a direct adaptation of such semi-supervised detectors for aerial\nimages where small clustered objects are often present, might not lead to\noptimal results.

In this work,\nwe introduce three indicators to evaluate the realism, diversity and\nprompt-generation consistency of text-to-image generative systems when prompted\nto generate objects from across the world. Our indicators complement\nqualitative analysis of the broader impact of such systems by enabling\nautomatic and efficient benchmarking of geographic disparities, an important\nstep towards building responsible visual content creation systems. We use our\nproposed indicators to analyze potential geographic biases in state-of-the-art\nvisual content creation systems and find that: (1) models have less realism and\ndiversity of generations when prompting for Africa and West Asia than Europe,\n(2) prompting with geographic information comes at a cost to prompt-consistency\nand diversity of generated images, and (3) models exhibit more region-level\ndisparities for some objects than others. Perhaps most interestingly, our\nindicators suggest that progress in image generation quality has come at the\ncost of real-world geographic representation.

        "summary": "Complex emotion recognition is a cognitive task that has so far eluded the\nsame excellent performance of other tasks that are at or above the level of\nhuman cognition. Emotion recognition through facial expressions is particularly\ndifficult due to the complexity of emotions expressed by the human face. For a\nmachine to approach the same level of performance in this domain as a human, it\nmay need to synthesise knowledge and understand new concepts in real-time as\nhumans do. Humans are able to learn new concepts using only few examples, by\ndistilling the important information from memories and discarding the rest.\nSimilarly, continual learning methods learn new classes whilst retaining the\nknowledge of known classes, whilst few-shot learning methods are able to learn\nnew classes using very few training examples. We propose a novel continual\nlearning method inspired by human cognition and learning that can accurately\nrecognise new compound expression classes using few training samples, by\nbuilding on and retaining its knowledge of basic expression classes. Using\nGradCAM visualisations, we demonstrate the relationship between basic and\ncompound facial expressions, which our method leverages through knowledge\ndistillation and a novel Predictive Sorting Memory Replay. Our method achieves\nthe current state-of-the-art in continual learning for complex facial\nexpression recognition with 74.28% Overall Accuracy on new classes. We also\ndemonstrate that using continual learning for complex facial expression\nrecognition achieves far better performance than non-continual learning\nmethods, improving on state-of-the-art non-continual learning methods by\n13.95%. To the best of our knowledge, our work is also the first to apply\nfew-shot learning to complex facial expression recognition, achieving the\nstate-of-the-art with 100% accuracy using a single training sample for each\nexpression class.",

This task is to localize the objects in\nthe images given only the image-level supervision.

However, existing solutions\nunder this pipeline usually suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) they are\nnot flexible since they can only localize one object for each image due to the\nadopted single-class regression (SCR) for localization; 2) the generated pseudo\nbounding boxes may be noisy, but the negative impact of such noise is not well\naddressed.

In this\npaper, we present DatasetDM, a generic dataset generation model that can\nproduce diverse synthetic images and the corresponding high-quality perception\nannotations (e.g., segmentation masks, and depth). Our method builds upon the\npre-trained diffusion model and extends text-guided image synthesis to\nperception data generation.

Training the decoder only needs less than 1% (around 100\nimages) manually labeled images, enabling the generation of an infinitely large\nannotated dataset. Then these synthetic data can be used for training various\nperception models for downstream tasks. To showcase the power of the proposed\napproach, we generate datasets with rich dense pixel-wise labels for a wide\nrange of downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, instance\nsegmentation, and depth estimation.

Typically, deep-sea exploration involves the use of\nautonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with high-resolution cameras and\nartificial illumination systems.

We simply regard\n$K$-keypoint pose estimation as predicting a set of $N\\times K$ keypoint\npositions, each from a keypoint query, as well as representing each pose with\nan instance query for scoring $N$ pose predictions. Motivated by the intuition\nthat the interaction, among across-instance queries of different types, is not\ndirectly helpful, we make a simple modification to decoder self-attention. We\nreplace single self-attention over all the $N\\times(K+1)$ queries with two\nsubsequent group self-attentions: (i) $N$ within-instance self-attention, with\neach over $K$ keypoint queries and one instance query, and (ii) $(K+1)$\nsame-type across-instance self-attention, each over $N$ queries of the same\ntype.

We found that its success can be largely attributed to its\npowerful skills in generating and executing code, evaluating the output of code\nexecution, and rectifying its solution when receiving unreasonable outputs.\nBased on this insight, we propose a novel and effective prompting method,\nexplicit \\uline{c}ode-based \\uline{s}elf-\\uline{v}erification~(CSV), to further\nboost the mathematical reasoning potential of GPT-4 Code Interpreter. This\nmethod employs a zero-shot prompt on GPT-4 Code Interpreter to encourage it to\nuse code to self-verify its answers. In instances where the verification state\nregisters as ``False'', the model shall automatically amend its solution,\nanalogous to our approach of rectifying errors during a mathematics\nexamination. Furthermore, we recognize that the states of the verification\nresult indicate the confidence of a solution, which can improve the\neffectiveness of majority voting.

The key idea is to\nenhance object-awareness during training by tasking the model to predict hand\npositions, object positions, and the semantic label of the objects using paired\ncaptions when available. At inference time the model only requires RGB frames\nas inputs, and is able to track and ground objects (although it has not been\ntrained explicitly for this). We demonstrate the performance of the\nobject-aware representations learnt by our model, by: (i) evaluating it for\nstrong transfer, i.e. through zero-shot testing, on a number of downstream\nvideo-text retrieval and classification benchmarks; and (ii) by using the\nrepresentations learned as input for long-term video understanding tasks (e.g.\nEpisodic Memory in Ego4D). In all cases the performance improves over the state\nof the art -- even compared to networks trained with far larger batch sizes. We\nalso show that by using noisy image-level detection as pseudo-labels in\ntraining, the model learns to provide better bounding boxes using video\nconsistency, as well as grounding the words in the associated text\ndescriptions.

Compared to studio environments, this setting is\nmore practical and accessible but poses an extremely challenging ill-posed\nproblem. Previous neural human reconstruction methods are able to reconstruct\nanimatable avatars from sparse views using deformed Signed Distance Fields\n(SDF) but cannot recover material parameters for relighting. While\ndifferentiable inverse rendering-based methods have succeeded in material\nrecovery of static objects, it is not straightforward to extend them to dynamic\nhumans as it is computationally intensive to compute pixel-surface intersection\nand light visibility on deformed SDFs for inverse rendering. To solve this\nchallenge, we propose a Hierarchical Distance Query (HDQ) algorithm to\napproximate the world space distances under arbitrary human poses.\nSpecifically, we estimate coarse distances based on a parametric human model\nand compute fine distances by exploiting the local deformation invariance of\nSDF. Based on the HDQ algorithm, we leverage sphere tracing to efficiently\nestimate the surface intersection and light visibility. This allows us to\ndevelop the first system to recover animatable and relightable neural avatars\nfrom sparse view (or monocular) inputs.

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of deep learning models often attributes to their\nability to leverage massive training data. In contrast, such privilege has not\nyet fully benefited 3D deep learning, mainly due to the limited availability of\nlarge-scale 3D datasets. Merging multiple available data sources and letting\nthem collaboratively train a single model is a potential solution. However, due\nto the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets, such mixed supervision\ncould adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated\nperformance (i.e., negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In\nview of this challenge, we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT), a novel\nframework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D\nrepresentation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on\nthis framework, we propose Prompt-driven Normalization, which adapts the model\nto different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided\nCategorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces\nby leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify\nthat PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic\nlearning and produce generalizable representations. Notably, it achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on each dataset using a single weight-shared model\nwith supervised multi-dataset training. Moreover, when served as a pre-training\nframework, it outperforms other pre-training approaches regarding\nrepresentation quality and attains remarkable state-of-the-art performance\nacross over ten diverse downstream tasks spanning both indoor and outdoor 3D\nscenarios.",

Existing\n3D human generative models mainly generate a clothed 3D human as an\nundetectable 3D model in a single pass, while rarely considering the layer-wise\nnature of a clothed human body, which often consists of the human body and\nvarious clothes such as underwear, outerwear, trousers, shoes, etc. In this\nwork, we propose HumanLiff, the first layer-wise 3D human generative model with\na unified diffusion process. Specifically, HumanLiff firstly generates\nminimal-clothed humans, represented by tri-plane features, in a canonical\nspace, and then progressively generates clothes in a layer-wise manner. In this\nway, the 3D human generation is thus formulated as a sequence of\ndiffusion-based 3D conditional generation. To reconstruct more fine-grained 3D\nhumans with tri-plane representation, we propose a tri-plane shift operation\nthat splits each tri-plane into three sub-planes and shifts these sub-planes to\nenable feature grid subdivision. To further enhance the controllability of 3D\ngeneration with 3D layered conditions, HumanLiff hierarchically fuses tri-plane\nfeatures and 3D layered conditions to facilitate the 3D diffusion model\nlearning.

        "summary": "Hands are dexterous and highly versatile manipulators that are central to how\nhumans interact with objects and their environment. Consequently, modeling\nrealistic hand-object interactions, including the subtle motion of individual\nfingers, is critical for applications in computer graphics, computer vision,\nand mixed reality. Prior work on capturing and modeling humans interacting with\nobjects in 3D focuses on the body and object motion, often ignoring hand pose.\nIn contrast, we introduce GRIP, a learning-based method that takes, as input,\nthe 3D motion of the body and the object, and synthesizes realistic motion for\nboth hands before, during, and after object interaction. As a preliminary step\nbefore synthesizing the hand motion, we first use a network, ANet, to denoise\nthe arm motion. Then, we leverage the spatio-temporal relationship between the\nbody and the object to extract two types of novel temporal interaction cues,\nand use them in a two-stage inference pipeline to generate the hand motion. In\nthe first stage, we introduce a new approach to enforce motion temporal\nconsistency in the latent space (LTC), and generate consistent interaction\nmotions. In the second stage, GRIP generates refined hand poses to avoid\nhand-object penetrations. Given sequences of noisy body and object motion, GRIP\nupgrades them to include hand-object interaction. Quantitative experiments and\nperceptual studies demonstrate that GRIP outperforms baseline methods and\ngeneralizes to unseen objects and motions from different motion-capture\ndatasets.",

To tackle this, we present a causality inspired parsing\nparadigm termed CIParsing, which follows fundamental causal principles\ninvolving two causal properties for human parsing (i.e., the causal diversity\nand the causal invariance). Specifically, we assume that an input image is\nconstructed by a mix of causal factors (the characteristics of body parts) and\nnon-causal factors (external contexts), where only the former ones cause the\ngeneration process of human parsing.Since causal/non-causal factors are\nunobservable, a human parser in proposed CIParsing is required to construct\nlatent representations of causal factors and learns to enforce representations\nto satisfy the causal properties. In this way, the human parser is able to rely\non causal factors w.r.t relevant evidence rather than non-causal factors w.r.t\nspurious correlations, thus alleviating model degradation and yielding improved\nparsing ability.

This paper\npresents a novel method, namely CLIP saying no (CLIPN), which empowers the\nlogic of saying no within CLIP. Our key motivation is to equip CLIP with the\ncapability of distinguishing OOD and ID samples using positive-semantic prompts\nand negation-semantic prompts.

        "summary": "This paper presents IP-SLT, a simple yet effective framework for sign\nlanguage translation (SLT). Our IP-SLT adopts a recurrent structure and\nenhances the semantic representation (prototype) of the input sign language\nvideo via an iterative refinement manner. Our idea mimics the behavior of human\nreading, where a sentence can be digested repeatedly, till reaching accurate\nunderstanding. Technically, IP-SLT consists of feature extraction, prototype\ninitialization, and iterative prototype refinement. The initialization module\ngenerates the initial prototype based on the visual feature extracted by the\nfeature extraction module. Then, the iterative refinement module leverages the\ncross-attention mechanism to polish the previous prototype by aggregating it\nwith the original video feature. Through repeated refinement, the prototype\nfinally converges to a more stable and accurate state, leading to a fluent and\nappropriate translation. In addition, to leverage the sequential dependence of\nprototypes, we further propose an iterative distillation loss to compress the\nknowledge of the final iteration into previous ones. As the autoregressive\ndecoding process is executed only once in inference, our IP-SLT is ready to\nimprove various SLT systems with acceptable overhead. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on public benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the IP-SLT.",

NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\\deg} scenes\nfrom a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in\ncapturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a\nhybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any\nworld point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based and\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive than\neach.

This makes the results useful for downstream tasks like\nhuman action recognition or 3D graphics. Yet, no regressor is perfect, and\naccuracy can be affected by ambiguous image evidence or by poses and appearance\nthat are unseen during training. Most current HPS regressors, however, do not\nreport the confidence of their outputs, meaning that downstream tasks cannot\ndifferentiate accurate estimates from inaccurate ones. To address this, we\ndevelop POCO, a novel framework for training HPS regressors to estimate not\nonly a 3D human body, but also their confidence, in a single feed-forward pass.\nSpecifically, POCO estimates both the 3D body pose and a per-sample variance.\nThe key idea is to introduce a Dual Conditioning Strategy (DCS) for regressing\nuncertainty that is highly correlated to pose reconstruction quality. The POCO\nframework can be applied to any HPS regressor and here we evaluate it by\nmodifying HMR, PARE, and CLIFF. In all cases, training the network to reason\nabout uncertainty helps it learn to more accurately estimate 3D pose. While\nthis was not our goal, the improvement is modest but consistent. Our main\nmotivation is to provide uncertainty estimates for downstream tasks; we\ndemonstrate this in two ways: (1) We use the confidence estimates to bootstrap\nHPS training. Given unlabelled image data, we take the confident estimates of a\nPOCO-trained regressor as pseudo ground truth. Retraining with this\nautomatically-curated data improves accuracy. (2) We exploit uncertainty in\nvideo pose estimation by automatically identifying uncertain frames (e.g. due\nto occlusion) and inpainting these from confident frames.

This approach\nresulted in a significant increase in the Dice score (p&lt;0.001) and a notable\ndecrease in the number of images with failed segmentation (16.2% to 11.3%)\nwhereas the alternative approach of randomly selecting the same number of\nsegmentations for human referral did not achieve any significant improvement.\nOur results suggest that the proposed dQC framework has the potential to\naccurately identify poor-quality segmentations and may enable efficient\nDNN-based analysis of DCE-CMRI in a human-in-the-loop pipeline for clinical\ninterpretation and reporting of dynamic CMRI datasets.",

Since anomalies during deployment can lead to model failure,\ndetecting the anomaly can enhance the reliability of models, which is valuable\nin high-risk domains like medical imaging. This paper introduces Masked\nModality Cycles with Conditional Diffusion (MMCCD), a method that enables\nsegmentation of anomalies across diverse patterns in multimodal MRI. The method\nis based on two fundamental ideas. First, we propose the use of cyclic modality\ntranslation as a mechanism for enabling abnormality detection.\nImage-translation models learn tissue-specific modality mappings, which are\ncharacteristic of tissue physiology. Thus, these learned mappings fail to\ntranslate tissues or image patterns that have never been encountered during\ntraining, and the error enables their segmentation. Furthermore, we combine\nimage translation with a masked conditional diffusion model, which attempts to\n`imagine' what tissue exists under a masked area, further exposing unknown\npatterns as the generative model fails to recreate them. We evaluate our method\non a proxy task by training on healthy-looking slices of BraTS2021\nmulti-modality MRIs and testing on slices with tumors.

LACO\npredicts collisions between the robot and the environment, enabling flexible,\nconditional path planning without the need for manual object annotations, point\ncloud data, or ground-truth object meshes. In both simulation and the real\nworld, we demonstrate that LACO can facilitate complex, nuanced path plans that\nallow for interaction with objects that are safe to collide, rather than\nprohibiting any collision.",

To achieve this goal, the robot needs to have a\ncomprehensive understanding of the 3D structure and semantics of the scene.

GNFactor jointly optimizes a generalizable neural\nfield (GNF) as a reconstruction module and a Perceiver Transformer as a\ndecision-making module, leveraging a shared deep 3D voxel representation. To\nincorporate semantics in 3D, the reconstruction module utilizes a\nvision-language foundation model ($\\textit{e.g.}$, Stable Diffusion) to distill\nrich semantic information into the deep 3D voxel.

In this\npaper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges to\ncomprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs. Firstly, we construct\na comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-world\nimages and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27\nsubtasks. This dataset not only covers fundamental recognition and\ncomprehension but also extends to literary creation. Secondly, by integrating\ndetailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal input\ncontent into a form understandable by LLMs. This enables us to employ advanced\nLLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue without\nrequiring human intervention. Through validation, we demonstrate that powerful\nLVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveraging\ntheir textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences.

        "summary": "Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine\nlearning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various\nframeworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels.\nHowever, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the\ndifficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation\nalgorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation\nprotocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing\nHPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not\navailable. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress\ncompared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good\nevaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria\nand using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are\nchallenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and\nTest Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically\nachievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using\nproper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously\nunexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our\nimproved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameter\noptimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and hence\nresearch progress, within this important field going forward.",

The reason for comparing the\nSLAM-based approaches leveraging fiducial markers is because previous work has\nshown their superior performance over feature-only methods, with less\ncomputational burden compared to methods that use both feature and marker\ndetection without compromising the localization performance. The evaluation is\nconducted using indoor image sequences captured with a hand-held camera\ncontaining multiple fiducial markers in the environment.

Specifically, we first design the Learnable\ncross-Modal Association (LMA) module to automatically fuse voxel-view and\nrange-view features with image features, which fully utilize the rich semantic\ninformation of images and are robust to calibration errors. Then, the enhanced\nvoxel-view and range-view features are transformed to the point space,where\nthree views of point cloud features are further fused adaptively by the\nLearnable cross-View Association module (LVA). Notably, UniSeg achieves\npromising results in three public benchmarks, i.e., SemanticKITTI, nuScenes,\nand Waymo Open Dataset (WOD); it ranks 1st on two challenges of two benchmarks,\nincluding the LiDAR semantic segmentation challenge of nuScenes and panoptic\nsegmentation challenges of SemanticKITTI. Besides, we construct the OpenPCSeg\ncodebase, which is the largest and most comprehensive outdoor LiDAR\nsegmentation codebase. It contains most of the popular outdoor LiDAR\nsegmentation algorithms and provides reproducible implementations.

        "summary": "Text-to-image generative models often reflect the biases of the training\ndata, leading to unequal representations of underrepresented groups. This study\ninvestigates inclusive text-to-image generative models that generate images\nbased on human-written prompts and ensure the resulting images are uniformly\ndistributed across attributes of interest. Unfortunately, directly expressing\nthe desired attributes in the prompt often leads to sub-optimal results due to\nlinguistic ambiguity or model misrepresentation. Hence, this paper proposes a\ndrastically different approach that adheres to the maxim that \"a picture is\nworth a thousand words\". We show that, for some attributes, images can\nrepresent concepts more expressively than text. For instance, categories of\nskin tones are typically hard to specify by text but can be easily represented\nby example images. Building upon these insights, we propose a novel approach,\nITI-GEN, that leverages readily available reference images for Inclusive\nText-to-Image GENeration. The key idea is learning a set of prompt embeddings\nto generate images that can effectively represent all desired attribute\ncategories. More importantly, ITI-GEN requires no model fine-tuning, making it\ncomputationally efficient to augment existing text-to-image models. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ITI-GEN largely improves over state-of-the-art\nmodels to generate inclusive images from a prompt. Project page:\nhttps://czhang0528.github.io/iti-gen.",

Towards this end, both explicit and implicit 3D representations\nare heavily studied for a holistic modeling and capture of the whole human\n(e.g., body, clothing, face and hair), but neither representation is an optimal\nchoice in terms of representation efficacy since different parts of the human\navatar have different modeling desiderata. For example, meshes are generally\nnot suitable for modeling clothing and hair. Motivated by this, we present\nDisentangled Avatars~(DELTA), which models humans with hybrid explicit-implicit\n3D representations. DELTA takes a monocular RGB video as input, and produces a\nhuman avatar with separate body and clothing/hair layers. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate two important applications for DELTA. For the first one, we\nconsider the disentanglement of the human body and clothing and in the second,\nwe disentangle the face and hair. To do so, DELTA represents the body or face\nwith an explicit mesh-based parametric 3D model and the clothing or hair with\nan implicit neural radiance field. To make this possible, we design an\nend-to-end differentiable renderer that integrates meshes into volumetric\nrendering, enabling DELTA to learn directly from monocular videos without any\n3D supervision. Finally, we show that how these two applications can be easily\ncombined to model full-body avatars, such that the hair, face, body and\nclothing can be fully disentangled yet jointly rendered. Such a disentanglement\nenables hair and clothing transfer to arbitrary body shapes. We empirically\nvalidate the effectiveness of DELTA's disentanglement by demonstrating its\npromising performance on disentangled reconstruction, virtual clothing try-on\nand hairstyle transfer.

Self-supervised learning techniques, such as\ncontrastive and non-contrastive approaches, have been shown to learn rich and\neffective representations of digitized tissue samples with limited pathologist\nsupervision. Our analysis of vanilla SSL-pretrained models' attention\ndistribution reveals an insightful observation: sparsity in attention, i.e,\nmodels tends to localize most of their attention to some prominent patterns in\nthe image. Although attention sparsity can be beneficial in natural images due\nto these prominent patterns being the object of interest itself, this can be\nsub-optimal in digital pathology; this is because, unlike natural images,\ndigital pathology scans are not object-centric, but rather a complex phenotype\nof various spatially intermixed biological components. Inadequate\ndiversification of attention in these complex images could result in crucial\ninformation loss. To address this, we leverage cell segmentation to densely\nextract multiple histopathology-specific representations, and then propose a\nprior-guided dense pretext task for SSL, designed to match the multiple\ncorresponding representations between the views. Through this, the model learns\nto attend to various components more closely and evenly, thus inducing adequate\ndiversification in attention for capturing context rich representations.\nThrough quantitative and qualitative analysis on multiple tasks across cancer\ntypes, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method and observe that the attention\nis more globally distributed.",

One typical method for this task is SWAD, which involves\naveraging weights along the training trajectory. However, the success of weight\naveraging depends on the diversity of weights, which is limited when training\nwith a small learning rate. Instead, we observe that leveraging a large\nlearning rate can simultaneously promote weight diversity and facilitate the\nidentification of flat regions in the loss landscape. However, employing a\nlarge learning rate suffers from the convergence problem, which cannot be\nresolved by simply averaging the training weights. To address this issue, we\nintroduce a training strategy called Lookahead which involves the weight\ninterpolation, instead of average, between fast and slow weights. The fast\nweight explores the weight space with a large learning rate, which is not\nconverged while the slow weight interpolates with it to ensure the convergence.\nBesides, weight interpolation also helps identify flat minima by implicitly\noptimizing the local entropy loss that measures flatness.

        "summary": "RGB-D object recognition systems improve their predictive performances by\nfusing color and depth information, outperforming neural network architectures\nthat rely solely on colors. While RGB-D systems are expected to be more robust\nto adversarial examples than RGB-only systems, they have also been proven to be\nhighly vulnerable. Their robustness is similar even when the adversarial\nexamples are generated by altering only the original images' colors. Different\nworks highlighted the vulnerability of RGB-D systems; however, there is a\nlacking of technical explanations for this weakness. Hence, in our work, we\nbridge this gap by investigating the learned deep representation of RGB-D\nsystems, discovering that color features make the function learned by the\nnetwork more complex and, thus, more sensitive to small perturbations. To\nmitigate this problem, we propose a defense based on a detection mechanism that\nmakes RGB-D systems more robust against adversarial examples. We empirically\nshow that this defense improves the performances of RGB-D systems against\nadversarial examples even when they are computed ad-hoc to circumvent this\ndetection mechanism, and that is also more effective than adversarial training.",

A subset of viewpoint-agnostic monocular\n3D detection methods also do not explicitly leverage scene homography or\ngeometry during training, meaning that a model trained thusly can detect\nobjects in images from arbitrary viewpoints. Such works predict the projections\nof the 3D bounding boxes on the image plane to estimate the location of the 3D\nboxes, but these projections are not rectangular so the calculation of IoU\nbetween these projected polygons is not straightforward. This work proposes an\nefficient, fully differentiable algorithm for the calculation of IoU between\ntwo convex polygons, which can be utilized to compute the IoU between two 3D\nbounding box footprints viewed from an arbitrary angle. We test the performance\nof the proposed polygon IoU loss (PIoU loss) on three state-of-the-art\nviewpoint-agnostic 3D detection models. Experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed PIoU loss converges faster than L1 loss and that in 3D detection\nmodels, a combination of PIoU loss and L1 loss gives better results than L1\nloss alone (+1.64% AP70 for MonoCon on cars, +0.18% AP70 for RTM3D on cars, and\n+0.83%/+2.46% AP50/AP25 for MonoRCNN on cyclists).",

Notably, there are three major challenges for this\nlarge-vocabulary 3D generation: a) the need for expressive yet efficient 3D\nrepresentation; b) large diversity in geometry and texture across categories;\nc) complexity in the appearances of real-world objects. To this end, we propose\na novel triplane-based 3D-aware Diffusion model with TransFormer, DiffTF, for\nhandling challenges via three aspects. 1) Considering efficiency and\nrobustness, we adopt a revised triplane representation and improve the fitting\nspeed and accuracy. 2) To handle the drastic variations in geometry and\ntexture, we regard the features of all 3D objects as a combination of\ngeneralized 3D knowledge and specialized 3D features.

The issue can\ntraced back to the architectural design of VLMs or pre-training data.\nSpecifically, the current VLMs primarily emphasize utilizing multi-modal data\nwith a single image some, rather than multi-modal prompts with interleaved\nmultiple images and text. Even though some newly proposed VLMs could handle\nuser prompts with multiple images, pre-training data does not provide more\nsophisticated multi-modal prompts than interleaved image and text crawled from\nthe web.

Different from previous methods that tried to improve\nthe VSR performance for the target language by using knowledge learned from\nother languages, we explore whether we can increase the amount of training data\nitself for the different languages without human intervention. To this end, we\nemploy a Whisper model which can conduct both language identification and\naudio-based speech recognition. It serves to filter data of the desired\nlanguages and transcribe labels from the unannotated, multilingual audio-visual\ndata pool. By comparing the performances of VSR models trained on automatic\nlabels and the human-annotated labels, we show that we can achieve similar VSR\nperformance to that of human-annotated labels even without utilizing human\nannotations. Through the automated labeling process, we label large-scale\nunlabeled multilingual databases, VoxCeleb2 and AVSpeech, producing 1,002 hours\nof data for four low VSR resource languages, French, Italian, Spanish, and\nPortuguese.

The final number of\nclusters per diagnosis was chosen by either the elbow method or a compactness\nmetric balancing intra-lesion variance and cluster numbers.

        "summary": "Developing an agent capable of adapting to unseen environments remains a\ndifficult challenge in imitation learning. In this work, we present Adaptive\nReturn-conditioned Policy (ARP), an efficient framework designed to enhance the\nagent's generalization ability using natural language task descriptions and\npre-trained multimodal encoders. Our key idea is to calculate a similarity\nbetween visual observations and natural language instructions in the\npre-trained multimodal embedding space (such as CLIP) and use it as a reward\nsignal. We then train a return-conditioned policy using expert demonstrations\nlabeled with multimodal rewards. Because the multimodal rewards provide\nadaptive signals at each timestep, our ARP effectively mitigates the goal\nmisgeneralization. This results in superior generalization performances even\nwhen faced with unseen text instructions, compared to existing text-conditioned\npolicies. To improve the quality of rewards, we also introduce a fine-tuning\nmethod for pre-trained multimodal encoders, further enhancing the performance.\nVideo demonstrations and source code are available on the project website:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/2023arp.",

Such requirements hinder the\nuse in resource-limited environments and demand both software and hardware\noptimization. Another limitation is that deep models are usually specialized\ninto a single domain or task, requiring them to learn and store new parameters\nfor each new one. Multi-Domain Learning (MDL) attempts to solve this problem by\nlearning a single model that is capable of performing well in multiple domains.\nNevertheless, the models are usually larger than the baseline for a single\ndomain. This work tackles both of these problems: our objective is to prune\nmodels capable of handling multiple domains according to a user-defined budget,\nmaking them more computationally affordable while keeping a similar\nclassification performance. We achieve this by encouraging all domains to use a\nsimilar subset of filters from the baseline model, up to the amount defined by\nthe user's budget.

Under these\nmetrics, reconstructed images that are determined to resemble the original one\ngenerally indicate more privacy leakage. Images determined as overall\ndissimilar, on the other hand, indicate higher robustness against attack.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that these metrics well reflect human opinions,\nwhich, as a judgement for model privacy leakage, are more trustworthy. In this\npaper, we comprehensively study the faithfulness of these hand-crafted metrics\nto human perception of privacy information from the reconstructed images. On 5\ndatasets ranging from natural images, faces, to fine-grained classes, we use 4\nexisting attack methods to reconstruct images from many different\nclassification models and, for each reconstructed image, we ask multiple human\nannotators to assess whether this image is recognizable. Our studies reveal\nthat the hand-crafted metrics only have a weak correlation with the human\nevaluation of privacy leakage and that even these metrics themselves often\ncontradict each other. These observations suggest risks of current metrics in\nthe community. To address this potential risk, we propose a learning-based\nmeasure called SemSim to evaluate the Semantic Similarity between the original\nand reconstructed images. SemSim is trained with a standard triplet loss, using\nan original image as an anchor, one of its recognizable reconstructed images as\na positive sample, and an unrecognizable one as a negative. By training on\nhuman annotations, SemSim exhibits a greater reflection of privacy leakage on\nthe semantic level.

Current state-of-the art methods focus on estimating\ndense pixel-/voxel-wise motion fields in image space, which ignores the fact\nthat motion estimation is only relevant and useful within the anatomical\nobjects of interest, e.g., the heart. In this work, we model the heart as a 3D\nmesh consisting of epi- and endocardial surfaces. We propose a novel learning\nframework, DeepMesh, which propagates a template heart mesh to a subject space\nand estimates the 3D motion of the heart mesh from CMR images for individual\nsubjects. In DeepMesh, the heart mesh of the end-diastolic frame of an\nindividual subject is first reconstructed from the template mesh. Mesh-based 3D\nmotion fields with respect to the end-diastolic frame are then estimated from\n2D short- and long-axis CMR images. By developing a differentiable\nmesh-to-image rasterizer, DeepMesh is able to leverage 2D shape information\nfrom multiple anatomical views for 3D mesh reconstruction and mesh motion\nestimation. The proposed method estimates vertex-wise displacement and thus\nmaintains vertex correspondences between time frames, which is important for\nthe quantitative assessment of cardiac function across different subjects and\npopulations.

Meanwhile,\nrecent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability in\ngenerating layouts and programs to control downstream visual modules such as\nimage generation models. This raises an important question: can we leverage the\nknowledge embedded in these LLMs for temporally consistent long video\ngeneration? In this paper, we propose VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for\nconsistent multi-scene video generation that uses the knowledge of LLMs for\nvideo content planning and grounded video generation. Specifically, given a\nsingle text prompt, we first ask our video planner LLM (GPT-4) to expand it\ninto a 'video plan', which involves generating the scene descriptions, the\nentities with their respective layouts, the background for each scene, and\nconsistency groupings of the entities and backgrounds. Next, guided by this\noutput from the video planner, our video generator, Layout2Vid, has explicit\ncontrol over spatial layouts and can maintain temporal consistency of\nentities/backgrounds across scenes, while only trained with image-level\nannotations. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoDirectorGPT framework\nsubstantially improves layout and movement control in both single- and\nmulti-scene video generation and can generate multi-scene videos with visual\nconsistency across scenes, while achieving competitive performance with SOTAs\nin open-domain single-scene T2V generation. We also demonstrate that our\nframework can dynamically control the strength for layout guidance and can also\ngenerate videos with user-provided images.

        "summary": "Point cloud registration plays a crucial role in various fields, including\nrobotics, computer graphics, and medical imaging. This process involves\ndetermining spatial relationships between different sets of points, typically\nwithin a 3D space. In real-world scenarios, complexities arise from non-rigid\nmovements and partial visibility, such as occlusions or sensor noise, making\nnon-rigid registration a challenging problem. Classic non-rigid registration\nmethods are often computationally demanding, suffer from unstable performance,\nand, importantly, have limited theoretical guarantees. The optimal transport\nproblem and its unbalanced variations (e.g., the optimal partial transport\nproblem) have emerged as powerful tools for point-cloud registration,\nestablishing a strong benchmark in this field. These methods view point clouds\nas empirical measures and provide a mathematically rigorous way to quantify the\n`correspondence' between (the transformed) source and target points. In this\npaper, we approach the point-cloud registration problem through the lens of\noptimal transport theory and first propose a comprehensive set of non-rigid\nregistration methods based on the optimal partial transportation problem.\nSubsequently, leveraging the emerging work on efficient solutions to the\none-dimensional optimal partial transport problem, we extend our proposed\nalgorithms via slicing to gain significant computational efficiency, resulting\nin fast and robust non-rigid registration algorithms. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed methods and compare them against baselines on\nvarious 3D and 2D non-rigid registration problems where the source and target\npoint clouds are corrupted by random noise.",

Modelling dense non-rigid object\ndeformations in this setting remained largely unaddressed so far, although such\neffects can improve the realism of the downstream applications such as AR/VR\nand avatar communications. This is due to the severe ill-posedness of the\nmonocular view setting and the associated challenges. While it is possible to\nnaively track multiple non-rigid objects independently using 3D templates or\nparametric 3D models, such an approach would suffer from multiple artefacts in\nthe resulting 3D estimates such as depth ambiguity, unnatural intra-object\ncollisions and missing or implausible deformations. Hence, this paper\nintroduces the first method that addresses the fundamental challenges depicted\nabove and that allows tracking human hands interacting with human faces in 3D\nfrom single monocular RGB videos. We model hands as articulated objects\ninducing non-rigid face deformations during an active interaction. Our method\nrelies on a new hand-face motion and interaction capture dataset with realistic\nface deformations acquired with a markerless multi-view camera system. As a\npivotal step in its creation, we process the reconstructed raw 3D shapes with\nposition-based dynamics and an approach for non-uniform stiffness estimation of\nthe head tissues, which results in plausible annotations of the surface\ndeformations, hand-face contact regions and head-hand positions. At the core of\nour neural approach are a variational auto-encoder supplying the hand-face\ndepth prior and modules that guide the 3D tracking by estimating the contacts\nand the deformations.

To address these issues, a large binocular NIR image\ndataset (BNI-FAS) is constructed and published, which contains more than\n300,000 real face and plane attack images, and an Interpretable FAS Transformer\n(IFAST) is proposed that requires only weak supervision to produce\ninterpretable predictions.

To achieve this goal, we\nrepresent the canonical radiance field with voxel grids to enable efficient\nforward warping, and propose a differentiable warping process, including an\naverage splatting operation and an inpaint network, to resolve the many-to-one\nand one-to-many mapping issues.

We\nintroduce COOLer, a COntrastive- and cOntinual-Learning-based tracker, which\nincrementally learns to track new categories while preserving past knowledge by\ntraining on a combination of currently available ground truth labels and\npseudo-labels generated by the past tracker. To further exacerbate the\ndisentanglement of instance representations, we introduce a novel contrastive\nclass-incremental instance representation learning technique. Finally, we\npropose a practical evaluation protocol for continual learning for MOT and\nconduct experiments on the BDD100K and SHIFT datasets.

Recently, so-called soft-biometric\nprivacy-enhancement approaches have been introduced with the aim of canceling\nsoft-biometric attributes.

Motivated by this fact, this paper explores to what extent the\nnon-invertibility requirement can be met by methods that claim to provide\nsoft-biometric privacy protection. Additionally, a detailed vulnerability\nassessment of state-of-the-art face embedding extractors is analysed in terms\nof the transformation complexity used for privacy protection. In this context,\na well-known state-of-the-art face image reconstruction approach has been\nevaluated on protected face embeddings to break soft biometric privacy\nprotection. Experimental results show that biometric privacy-enhanced face\nembeddings can be reconstructed with an accuracy of up to approximately 98%,\ndepending on the complexity of the protection algorithm.",

To mitigate the aforementioned\nissues, we propose Soft Convex Quantization (SCQ) as a direct substitute for\nVQ.

Such issues make it infeasible to adopt\nconventional iterative global pruning, which is costly due to computing the\nHessian matrix of the entire large model for sparsification. Alternatively,\nseveral studies have recently proposed layer-wise pruning approaches to avoid\nthe expensive computation of global pruning and efficiently compress model\nweights according to their importance within a layer. However, these methods\noften suffer from suboptimal model compression due to their lack of a global\nperspective. To address this limitation in recent efficient pruning methods for\nlarge models, we propose Efficient Coarse-to-Fine Layer-Wise Pruning (ECoFLaP),\na two-stage coarse-to-fine weight pruning approach for LVLMs. We first\ndetermine the sparsity ratios of different layers or blocks by leveraging the\nglobal importance score, which is efficiently computed based on the\nzeroth-order approximation of the global model gradients. Then, the multimodal\nmodel performs local layer-wise unstructured weight pruning based on\nglobally-informed sparsity ratios.

However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion\ncues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained\nenvironments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group.\nAdditionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion\npredictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this\npaper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more\nrobust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty of each\nindividual, we utilize stochastic embedding drawn from a Gaussian distribution\ninstead of deterministic point embedding. This representation captures the\nprobabilities of different emotions and generates diverse predictions through\nthis stochasticity during the inference stage. Furthermore,\nuncertainty-sensitive scores are adaptively assigned as the fusion weights of\nindividuals' face within each group. Moreover, we develop an image enhancement\nmodule to enhance the model's robustness against severe noise. The overall\nthree-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene component, is guided\nby a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed\nuncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output.

In this paper, we\nintroduce HiFi-123, a method designed for high-fidelity and multi-view\nconsistent 3D generation. Our contributions are twofold: First, we propose a\nreference-guided novel view enhancement technique that substantially reduces\nthe quality gap between synthesized and reference views. Second, capitalizing\non the novel view enhancement, we present a novel reference-guided state\ndistillation loss. When incorporated into the optimization-based image-to-3D\npipeline, our method significantly improves 3D generation quality, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance.

This work introduces MatFormer, a nested\nTransformer architecture designed to offer elasticity in a variety of\ndeployment constraints. Each Feed Forward Network (FFN) block of a MatFormer\nmodel is jointly optimized with a few nested smaller FFN blocks. This training\nprocedure allows for the Mix'n'Match of model granularities across layers --\ni.e., a trained universal MatFormer model enables extraction of hundreds of\naccurate smaller models, which were never explicitly optimized. We empirically\ndemonstrate MatFormer's effectiveness across different model classes (decoders\n&amp; encoders), modalities (language &amp; vision), and scales (up to 2.6B\nparameters).

Existing works for higher-resolution generation, such as\nattention-based and joint-diffusion approaches, cannot well address these\nissues. As a new perspective, we examine the structural components of the U-Net\nin diffusion models and identify the crucial cause as the limited perception\nfield of convolutional kernels.

In this study,\nwe address this limitation by focusing on two key aspects: data quality and\ndata variety. Unlike recent LLM rewriting techniques, we emphasize exploiting\nvisual concepts and their integration into the captions to improve data\nquality. For data variety, we propose a novel mixed training scheme that\noptimally leverages AltTexts alongside newly generated Visual-enriched Captions\n(VeC).

Understanding these flares\ncan provide a window into black hole accretion processes. Although\nsophisticated simulations predict the formation of these flares, their\nstructure has yet to be recovered by observations.

        "summary": "Real-world robotic tasks stretch over extended horizons and encompass\nmultiple stages. Learning long-horizon manipulation tasks, however, is a\nlong-standing challenge, and demands decomposing the overarching task into\nseveral manageable subtasks to facilitate policy learning and generalization to\nunseen tasks. Prior task decomposition methods require task-specific knowledge,\nare computationally intensive, and cannot readily be applied to new tasks. To\naddress these shortcomings, we propose Universal Visual Decomposer (UVD), an\noff-the-shelf task decomposition method for visual long horizon manipulation\nusing pre-trained visual representations designed for robotic control. At a\nhigh level, UVD discovers subgoals by detecting phase shifts in the embedding\nspace of the pre-trained representation. Operating purely on visual\ndemonstrations without auxiliary information, UVD can effectively extract\nvisual subgoals embedded in the videos, while incurring zero additional\ntraining cost on top of standard visuomotor policy training. Goal-conditioned\npolicies learned with UVD-discovered subgoals exhibit significantly improved\ncompositional generalization at test time to unseen tasks. Furthermore,\nUVD-discovered subgoals can be used to construct goal-based reward shaping that\njump-starts temporally extended exploration for reinforcement learning. We\nextensively evaluate UVD on both simulation and real-world tasks, and in all\ncases, UVD substantially outperforms baselines across imitation and\nreinforcement learning settings on in-domain and out-of-domain task sequences\nalike, validating the clear advantage of automated visual task decomposition\nwithin the simple, compact UVD framework.",

To tackle these challenges,\nour key insight is that human image is inherently structural over multiple\ngranularities, from the coarse-level body skeleton to fine-grained spatial\ngeometry. Therefore, capturing such correlations between the explicit\nappearance and latent structure in one model is essential to generate coherent\nand natural human images. To this end, we propose a unified framework,\nHyperHuman, that generates in-the-wild human images of high realism and diverse\nlayouts. Specifically, 1) we first build a large-scale human-centric dataset,\nnamed HumanVerse, which consists of 340M images with comprehensive annotations\nlike human pose, depth, and surface normal. 2) Next, we propose a Latent\nStructural Diffusion Model that simultaneously denoises the depth and surface\nnormal along with the synthesized RGB image. Our model enforces the joint\nlearning of image appearance, spatial relationship, and geometry in a unified\nnetwork, where each branch in the model complements to each other with both\nstructural awareness and textural richness. 3) Finally, to further boost the\nvisual quality, we propose a Structure-Guided Refiner to compose the predicted\nconditions for more detailed generation of higher resolution.

Thanks to the recent breakthrough\nof cross-modal models (e.g., CLIP), HairCLIP is the first work that enables\nhair editing based on text descriptions or reference images.

Our approach improves upon recent state-of-the art deep functional\nmap methods and can be applied to a broad range of different challenging\nscenarios. Previous deep functional map methods mainly focus on feature\nextraction and aim exclusively at obtaining more expressive features for\nfunctional map computation. However, the importance of the functional map\ncomputation itself is often neglected and the relationship between the\nfunctional map and point-wise map is underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate the coupling relationship between the functional map\nfrom the functional map solver and the point-wise map based on feature\nsimilarity. To this end, we propose a self-adaptive functional map solver to\nadjust the functional map regularisation for different shape matching\nscenarios, together with a vertex-wise contrastive loss to obtain more\ndiscriminative features. Using different challenging datasets (including\nnon-isometry, topological noise and partiality), we demonstrate that our method\nsubstantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.",

Although good performance can be\nobtained by enhancing the features of the change regions, however, these works\nare still limited mainly due to the ignorance of mining the unchanged\nbackground context information. It is known that one main challenge for change\ndetection is how to obtain the consistent representations for two images\ninvolving different variations, such as spatial variation, sunlight intensity,\netc. In this work, we demonstrate that carefully mining the common background\ninformation provides an important cue to learn the consistent representations\nfor the two images which thus obviously facilitates the visual change detection\nproblem. Based on this observation, we propose a novel Visual change\nTransformer (VcT) model for visual change detection problem. To be specific, a\nshared backbone network is first used to extract the feature maps for the given\nimage pair. Then, each pixel of feature map is regarded as a graph node and the\ngraph neural network is proposed to model the structured information for coarse\nchange map prediction. Top-K reliable tokens can be mined from the map and\nrefined by using the clustering algorithm. Then, these reliable tokens are\nenhanced by first utilizing self/cross-attention schemes and then interacting\nwith original features via an anchor-primary attention learning module.\nFinally, the prediction head is proposed to get a more accurate change map.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validated the\neffectiveness of our proposed VcT model.",

One\npopular strategy is to explore extra data with image-level labels, yet it\nproduces limited results due to (1) semantic ambiguity -- an image-level label\nonly captures a salient part of the image, ignoring the remaining rich\nsemantics within the image; and (2) location sensitivity -- the label highly\ndepends on the locations and crops of the original image, which may change\nafter data transformations like random cropping. To remedy this, we propose\nRichSem, a simple but effective method, which is robust to learn rich semantics\nfrom coarse locations without the need of accurate bounding boxes. RichSem\nleverages rich semantics from images, which are then served as additional soft\nsupervision for training detectors.

However, we find\nthat the optimal number of inversion steps for achieving ideal editing results\nvaries significantly among different editing pairs, owing to varying editing\ndifficulties. Therefore, the current literature, which relies on a fixed number\nof inversion steps, produces sub-optimal generation quality, especially when\nhandling multiple editing pairs in a natural image.

However, conventional SDEs typically assume the\nunderlying noise to follow a Brownian motion (BM), which hinders their ability\nto capture long-term dependencies. In contrast, fractional Brownian motion\n(fBM) extends BM to encompass non-Markovian dynamics, but existing methods for\ninferring fBM parameters are either computationally demanding or statistically\ninefficient. In this paper, building upon the Markov approximation of fBM, we\nderive the evidence lower bound essential for efficient variational inference\nof posterior path measures, drawing from the well-established field of\nstochastic analysis.

Even more intriguingly, this can be achieved\nby a simple yet previously overlooked strategy -- employing a frozen\ntransformer block from pre-trained LLMs as a constituent encoder layer to\ndirectly process visual tokens. Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging\nLLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional\npractices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with\nassociated language prompts, inputs, or outputs. We demonstrate that our\napproach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks,\nencompassing pure 2D and 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point\ncloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition),\nnon-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g.,\n2D/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval). Such improvements\nare a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and\nOPT) and different LLM transformer blocks. We additionally propose the\ninformation filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained\nLLMs in visual encoding -- the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks discern\ninformative visual tokens and further amplify their effect. This hypothesis is\nempirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after\ntraining with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant\nregions.

        "summary": "The creation of photorealistic virtual worlds requires the accurate modeling\nof 3D surface geometry for a wide range of objects. For this, meshes are\nappealing since they 1) enable fast physics-based rendering with realistic\nmaterial and lighting, 2) support physical simulation, and 3) are\nmemory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing\nand statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being\ntopologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D\nrepresentation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin,\nopen, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for\nreconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material\nand lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation\nthat open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we\nparameterize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on\nwatertight templates. With this parameterization, we further develop a\ngrid-based and differentiable representation that parameterizes both watertight\nand non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called\nGhost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications:\ndifferentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and\ngenerative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate that\nG-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight mesh\nreconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively for\nwatertight meshes.",

However, they are extremely hungry\nfor delicate annotations to train, and the acquisition is laborious and\nunaffordable. Therefore, we present FreeMask in this work, which resorts to\nsynthetic images from generative models to ease the burden of both data\ncollection and annotation procedures. Concretely, we first synthesize abundant\ntraining images conditioned on the semantic masks provided by realistic\ndatasets. This yields extra well-aligned image-mask training pairs for semantic\nsegmentation models. We surprisingly observe that, solely trained with\nsynthetic images, we already achieve comparable performance with real ones\n(e.g., 48.3 vs. 48.5 mIoU on ADE20K, and 49.3 vs. 50.5 on COCO-Stuff). Then, we\ninvestigate the role of synthetic images by joint training with real images, or\npre-training for real images. Meantime, we design a robust filtering principle\nto suppress incorrectly synthesized regions. In addition, we propose to\ninequally treat different semantic masks to prioritize those harder ones and\nsample more corresponding synthetic images for them. As a result, either\njointly trained or pre-trained with our filtered and re-sampled synthesized\nimages, segmentation models can be greatly enhanced, e.g., from 48.7 to 52.0 on\nADE20K.

To accommodate\nthis, many works generate a diverse set of outputs by attempting to randomly\nsample from the posterior distribution of natural images given the degraded\ninput. Here we argue that this strategy is commonly of limited practical value\nbecause of the heavy tail of the posterior distribution. Consider for example\ninpainting a missing region of the sky in an image. Since there is a high\nprobability that the missing region contains no object but clouds, any set of\nsamples from the posterior would be entirely dominated by (practically\nidentical) completions of sky.

While current research demonstrates advanced performance in\nreconstructing DFFs from dense views, the development of learning a DFF from\nsparse views is relatively nascent, despite its prevalence in numerous\nmanipulation tasks with fixed cameras. In this work, we introduce SparseDFF, a\nnovel method for acquiring view-consistent 3D DFFs from sparse RGBD\nobservations, enabling one-shot learning of dexterous manipulations that are\ntransferable to novel scenes. Specifically, we map the image features to the 3D\npoint cloud, allowing for propagation across the 3D space to establish a dense\nfeature field. At the core of SparseDFF is a lightweight feature refinement\nnetwork, optimized with a contrastive loss between pairwise views after\nback-projecting the image features onto the 3D point cloud.

        "summary": "We propose LLM-FP4 for quantizing both weights and activations in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) down to 4-bit floating-point values, in a post-training\nmanner. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) solutions are primarily\ninteger-based and struggle with bit widths below 8 bits. Compared to integer\nquantization, floating-point (FP) quantization is more flexible and can better\nhandle long-tail or bell-shaped distributions, and it has emerged as a default\nchoice in many hardware platforms. One characteristic of FP quantization is\nthat its performance largely depends on the choice of exponent bits and\nclipping range. In this regard, we construct a strong FP-PTQ baseline by\nsearching for the optimal quantization parameters. Furthermore, we observe a\nhigh inter-channel variance and low intra-channel variance pattern in\nactivation distributions, which adds activation quantization difficulty. We\nrecognize this pattern to be consistent across a spectrum of transformer models\ndesigned for diverse tasks, such as LLMs, BERT, and Vision Transformer models.\nTo tackle this, we propose per-channel activation quantization and show that\nthese additional scaling factors can be reparameterized as exponential biases\nof weights, incurring a negligible cost. Our method, for the first time, can\nquantize both weights and activations in the LLaMA-13B to only 4-bit and\nachieves an average score of 63.1 on the common sense zero-shot reasoning\ntasks, which is only 5.8 lower than the full-precision model, significantly\noutperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 12.7 points.

When specialized in dense\nproblems such as object detection, learning local rather than global\ninformation in images has proven to be more efficient.

To address this problem, we are\ninterested in transformer-based object detectors that have recently gained\ntraction in the community with good performance and with the particularity of\ngenerating many diverse object proposals.\n  In this work, we present Proposal Selection Contrast (ProSeCo), a novel\nunsupervised overall pretraining approach that leverages this property. ProSeCo\nuses the large number of object proposals generated by the detector for\ncontrastive learning, which allows the use of a smaller batch size, combined\nwith object-level features to learn local information in the images. To improve\nthe effectiveness of the contrastive loss, we introduce the object location\ninformation in the selection of positive examples to take into account multiple\noverlapping object proposals.

Recently, some works have attempted to train\na NeRF from a single image with 3D priors. They mainly focus on a limited field\nof view and there are few invisible occlusions, which greatly limits their\nscalability to real-world 360-degree panoramic scenarios with large-size\nocclusions. In this paper, we present PERF, a 360-degree novel view synthesis\nframework that trains a panoramic neural radiance field from a single panorama.\nNotably, PERF allows 3D roaming in a complex scene without expensive and\ntedious image collection. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel\ncollaborative RGBD inpainting method and a progressive inpainting-and-erasing\nmethod to lift up a 360-degree 2D scene to a 3D scene. Specifically, we first\npredict a panoramic depth map as initialization given a single panorama, and\nreconstruct visible 3D regions with volume rendering. Then we introduce a\ncollaborative RGBD inpainting approach into a NeRF for completing RGB images\nand depth maps from random views, which is derived from an RGB Stable Diffusion\nmodel and a monocular depth estimator. Finally, we introduce an\ninpainting-and-erasing strategy to avoid inconsistent geometry between a\nnewly-sampled view and reference views.

We tackle the problem by\nleveraging a 2D reference image to guide the stages of geometry sculpting and\ntexture boosting. A central focus of this work is to address the consistency\nissue that existing works encounter. To sculpt geometries that render\ncoherently, we perform score distillation sampling via a view-dependent\ndiffusion model. This 3D prior, alongside several training strategies,\nprioritizes the geometry consistency but compromises the texture fidelity. We\nfurther propose Bootstrapped Score Distillation to specifically boost the\ntexture. We train a personalized diffusion model, Dreambooth, on the augmented\nrenderings of the scene, imbuing it with 3D knowledge of the scene being\noptimized. The score distillation from this 3D-aware diffusion prior provides\nview-consistent guidance for the scene. Notably, through an alternating\noptimization of the diffusion prior and 3D scene representation, we achieve\nmutually reinforcing improvements: the optimized 3D scene aids in training the\nscene-specific diffusion model, which offers increasingly view-consistent\nguidance for 3D optimization. The optimization is thus bootstrapped and leads\nto substantial texture boosting.

Using public model libraries comprising thousands of models\ntrained on canonical datasets like ImageNet, we observe that for arbitrary\npairings of pretrained models, one model extracts significant data context\nunavailable in the other -- independent of overall performance. Given any\narbitrary pairing of pretrained models and no external rankings (such as\nseparate test sets, e.g. due to data privacy), we investigate if it is possible\nto transfer such \"complementary\" knowledge from one model to another without\nperformance degradation -- a task made particularly difficult as additional\nknowledge can be contained in stronger, equiperformant or weaker models. Yet\nfacilitating robust transfer in scenarios agnostic to pretrained model pairings\nwould unlock auxiliary gains and knowledge fusion from any model repository\nwithout restrictions on model and problem specifics - including from weaker,\nlower-performance models. This work therefore provides an initial, in-depth\nexploration on the viability of such general-purpose knowledge transfer. Across\nlarge-scale experiments, we first reveal the shortcomings of standard knowledge\ndistillation techniques, and then propose a much more general extension through\ndata partitioning for successful transfer between nearly all pretrained models,\nwhich we show can also be done unsupervised.

Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain\ntransferability but largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which\nempirically results in even worse discriminability. In this work, we introduce\na novel graph SPectral Alignment (SPA) framework to tackle the tradeoff. The\ncore of our method is briefly condensed as follows: (i)-by casting the DA\nproblem to graph primitives, SPA composes a coarse graph alignment mechanism\nwith a novel spectral regularizer towards aligning the domain graphs in\neigenspaces; (ii)-we further develop a fine-grained message propagation module\n-- upon a novel neighbor-aware self-training mechanism -- in order for enhanced\ndiscriminability in the target domain. On standardized benchmarks, the\nextensive experiments of SPA demonstrate that its performance has surpassed the\nexisting cutting-edge DA methods. Coupled with dense model analysis, we\nconclude that our approach indeed possesses superior efficacy, robustness,\ndiscriminability, and transferability.

In these datasets,\nonly a few classes (known as the head classes) have an adequate number of\ntraining samples, while the rest of the classes (known as the tail classes) are\ninfrequent in the training data. Re-sampling is a classical and widely used\napproach for addressing class imbalance issues. Unfortunately, recent studies\nclaim that re-sampling brings negligible performance improvements in modern\nlong-tail learning tasks. This paper aims to investigate this phenomenon\nsystematically. Our research shows that re-sampling can considerably improve\ngeneralization when the training images do not contain semantically irrelevant\ncontexts. In other scenarios, however, it can learn unexpected spurious\ncorrelations between irrelevant contexts and target labels. We design\nexperiments on two homogeneous datasets, one containing irrelevant context and\nthe other not, to confirm our findings. To prevent the learning of spurious\ncorrelations, we propose a new context shift augmentation module that generates\ndiverse training images for the tail class by maintaining a context bank\nextracted from the head-class images.

        "summary": "Person search (PS) is a challenging computer vision problem where the\nobjective is to achieve joint optimization for pedestrian detection and\nre-identification (ReID). Although previous advancements have shown promising\nperformance in the field under fully and weakly supervised learning fashion,\nthere exists a major gap in investigating the domain adaptation ability of PS\nmodels. In this paper, we propose a diligent domain adaptive mixer (DDAM) for\nperson search (DDAP-PS) framework that aims to bridge a gap to improve\nknowledge transfer from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target\ndomain. Specifically, we introduce a novel DDAM module that generates moderate\nmixed-domain representations by combining source and target domain\nrepresentations. The proposed DDAM module encourages domain mixing to minimize\nthe distance between the two extreme domains, thereby enhancing the ReID task.\nTo achieve this, we introduce two bridge losses and a disparity loss. The\nobjective of the two bridge losses is to guide the moderate mixed-domain\nrepresentations to maintain an appropriate distance from both the source and\ntarget domain representations. The disparity loss aims to prevent the moderate\nmixed-domain representations from being biased towards either the source or\ntarget domains, thereby avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, we address the\nconflict between the two subtasks, localization and ReID, during domain\nadaptation. To handle this cross-task conflict, we forcefully decouple the\nnorm-aware embedding, which aids in better learning of the moderate\nmixed-domain representation. We conduct experiments to validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. Our approach demonstrates favorable\nperformance on the challenging PRW and CUHK-SYSU datasets.

This paper presents a short-to-long video\ndiffusion model, SEINE, that focuses on generative transition and prediction.\nThe goal is to generate high-quality long videos with smooth and creative\ntransitions between scenes and varying lengths of shot-level videos.\nSpecifically, we propose a random-mask video diffusion model to automatically\ngenerate transitions based on textual descriptions. By providing the images of\ndifferent scenes as inputs, combined with text-based control, our model\ngenerates transition videos that ensure coherence and visual quality.\nFurthermore, the model can be readily extended to various tasks such as\nimage-to-video animation and autoregressive video prediction.

An idempotent operator is one that can be applied\nsequentially without changing the result beyond the initial application, namely\n$f(f(z))=f(z)$. The proposed model $f$ is trained to map a source distribution\n(e.g, Gaussian noise) to a target distribution (e.g. realistic images) using\nthe following objectives: (1) Instances from the target distribution should map\nto themselves, namely $f(x)=x$. We define the target manifold as the set of all\ninstances that $f$ maps to themselves. (2) Instances that form the source\ndistribution should map onto the defined target manifold. This is achieved by\noptimizing the idempotence term, $f(f(z))=f(z)$ which encourages the range of\n$f(z)$ to be on the target manifold. Under ideal assumptions such a process\nprovably converges to the target distribution. This strategy results in a model\ncapable of generating an output in one step, maintaining a consistent latent\nspace, while also allowing sequential applications for refinement.\nAdditionally, we find that by processing inputs from both target and source\ndistributions, the model adeptly projects corrupted or modified data back to\nthe target manifold.

Conventional deepfake detection methods train\nsupervised classifiers to distinguish real media from previously encountered\ndeepfakes. Such techniques can only detect deepfakes similar to those\npreviously seen, but not zero-day (previously unseen) attack types. As current\ndeepfake generation techniques are changing at a breathtaking pace, new attack\ntypes are proposed frequently, making this a major issue. Our main observations\nare that: i) in many effective deepfake attacks, the fake media must be\naccompanied by false facts i.e. claims about the identity, speech, motion, or\nappearance of the person. For instance, when impersonating Obama, the attacker\nexplicitly or implicitly claims that the fake media show Obama; ii) current\ngenerative techniques cannot perfectly synthesize the false facts claimed by\nthe attacker. We therefore introduce the concept of \"fact checking\", adapted\nfrom fake news detection, for detecting zero-day deepfake attacks. Fact\nchecking verifies that the claimed facts (e.g. identity is Obama), agree with\nthe observed media (e.g. is the face really Obama's?), and thus can\ndifferentiate between real and fake media. Consequently, we introduce FACTOR, a\npractical recipe for deepfake fact checking and demonstrate its power in\ncritical attack settings: face swapping and audio-visual synthesis. Although it\nis training-free, relies exclusively on off-the-shelf features, is very easy to\nimplement, and does not see any deepfakes, it achieves better than\nstate-of-the-art accuracy.",

This illness, which\noften appears in the second decade of life, affects people of all sexes and\nraces. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one of the deep learning\napproaches, have recently come to light as particularly promising tools for the\naccurate and timely diagnosis of keratoconus. The purpose of this study was to\nevaluate how well different D-CNN models identified keratoconus-related\ndiseases. To be more precise, we compared five different CNN-based deep\nlearning architectures (DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, VGG19,\nXception). In our comprehensive experimental analysis, the DenseNet201-based\nmodel performed very well in keratoconus disease identification in our\nextensive experimental research. This model outperformed its D-CNN equivalents,\nwith an astounding accuracy rate of 89.14% in three crucial classes:\nKeratoconus, Normal, and Suspect. The results demonstrate not only the\nstability and robustness of the model but also its practical usefulness in\nreal-world applications for accurate and dependable keratoconus identification.\nIn addition, D-CNN DenseNet201 performs extraordinarily well in terms of\nprecision, recall rates, and F1 scores in addition to accuracy. These measures\nvalidate the model's usefulness as an effective diagnostic tool by highlighting\nits capacity to reliably detect instances of keratoconus and to reduce false\npositives and negatives.",

However, they are limited to\nonly referring a single object category at a time, require users to specify the\nregions in inputs, or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding. In this\nwork, we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM), the first model that can generate\nnatural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object\nsegmentation masks.

However, current\nlarge vision-language foundation models (VLMs) fall short of such compositional\nabilities due to their \"bag-of-words\" behaviors and inability to construct\nwords that correctly represent visual entities and the relations among the\nentities. To this end, we propose CoVLM, which can guide the LLM to explicitly\ncompose visual entities and relationships among the text and dynamically\ncommunicate with the vision encoder and detection network to achieve\nvision-language communicative decoding. Specifically, we first devise a set of\nnovel communication tokens for the LLM, for dynamic communication between the\nvisual detection system and the language system. A communication token is\ngenerated by the LLM following a visual entity or a relation, to inform the\ndetection network to propose regions that are relevant to the sentence\ngenerated so far. The proposed regions-of-interests (ROIs) are then fed back\ninto the LLM for better language generation contingent on the relevant regions.\nThe LLM is thus able to compose the visual entities and relationships through\nthe communication tokens. The vision-to-language and language-to-vision\ncommunication are iteratively performed until the entire sentence is generated.\nOur framework seamlessly bridges the gap between visual perception and LLMs and\noutperforms previous VLMs by a large margin on compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks (e.g., ~20% in HICO-DET mAP, ~14% in Cola top-1 accuracy, and ~3% on\nARO top-1 accuracy).

We propose an alternative quantization strategy that\ndecomposes the learning problem in two stages: first, perform similarity\nlearning over the embedding space with no quantization; second, find an optimal\northogonal transformation of the embeddings so each coordinate of the embedding\nis close to its sign, and then quantize the transformed embedding through the\nsign function.

We\ndescribe how to identify these groups, explore what sets them apart, and\ncarefully study their effect on the network's optimization and behavior. We\ncomplement these experiments with a mechanistic explanation on a toy example of\nopposing signals and a theoretical analysis of a two-layer linear network on a\nsimple model.

Existing approaches use\nclassic convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for the visual encoder and\ntransformers for the textual decoder. However, this hybrid CNN-Transformer\narchitecture introduces a complex visual encoder that accounts for nearly half\nof the total model parameters, markedly reduces both training and inference\nspeed, and hinders the potential for self-supervised learning in TSR.

The convolutional stem strikes\nan optimal balance between two crucial factors for high-performance TSR: a\nhigher receptive field (RF) ratio and a longer sequence length. This allows it\nto \"see\" an appropriate portion of the table and \"store\" the complex table\nstructure within sufficient context length for the subsequent transformer.

        "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that\nenables collaborative model training across dispersed nodes without having to\nforce individual nodes to share data. However, its broad adoption is hindered\nby the high communication costs of transmitting a large number of model\nparameters. This paper presents EvoFed, a novel approach that integrates\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) with FL to address these challenges. EvoFed\nemploys a concept of 'fitness-based information sharing', deviating\nsignificantly from the conventional model-based FL. Rather than exchanging the\nactual updated model parameters, each node transmits a distance-based\nsimilarity measure between the locally updated model and each member of the\nnoise-perturbed model population. Each node, as well as the server, generates\nan identical population set of perturbed models in a completely synchronized\nfashion using the same random seeds. With properly chosen noise variance and\npopulation size, perturbed models can be combined to closely reflect the actual\nmodel updated using the local dataset, allowing the transmitted similarity\nmeasures (or fitness values) to carry nearly the complete information about the\nmodel parameters. As the population size is typically much smaller than the\nnumber of model parameters, the savings in communication load is large. The\nserver aggregates these fitness values and is able to update the global model.\nThis global fitness vector is then disseminated back to the nodes, each of\nwhich applies the same update to be synchronized to the global model. Our\nanalysis shows that EvoFed converges, and our experimental results validate\nthat at the cost of increased local processing loads, EvoFed achieves\nperformance comparable to FedAvg while reducing overall communication\nrequirements drastically in various practical settings.",

While\nseveral existing works have achieved impressive results for this task, they\nmainly rely on a time-consuming optimization paradigm. Specifically, these\nmethods optimize a neural field from scratch for each text prompt, taking\napproximately one hour or more to generate one object. This heavy and\nrepetitive training cost impedes their practical deployment. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework for fast text-to-3D generation, dubbed Instant3D.\nOnce trained, Instant3D is able to create a 3D object for an unseen text prompt\nin less than one second with a single run of a feedforward network. We achieve\nthis remarkable speed by devising a new network that directly constructs a 3D\ntriplane from a text prompt. The core innovation of our Instant3D lies in our\nexploration of strategies to effectively inject text conditions into the\nnetwork. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective activation function,\nthe scaled-sigmoid, to replace the original sigmoid function, which speeds up\nthe training convergence by more than ten times. Finally, to address the Janus\n(multi-head) problem in 3D generation, we propose an adaptive Perp-Neg\nalgorithm that can dynamically adjust its concept negation scales according to\nthe severity of the Janus problem during training, effectively reducing the\nmulti-head effect.

LfO can\nfacilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and\nreducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a\ntransformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and\naction pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation\nor inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While\nseveral existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity\nrecognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However,\nSA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single\nviewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the\nobserved task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing\nocclusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and\nsynchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present\nmulti-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception\nof multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better\nrecognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on two\ndistinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairs\nunder occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and other\nbaselines.

Volumetric encodings are\nessential to represent fuzzy geometry such as foliage and hair, and they are\nwell-suited for stochastic optimization. Yet, many scenes ultimately consist\nlargely of solid surfaces which can be accurately rendered by a single sample\nper pixel. Based on this insight, we propose a neural radiance formulation that\nsmoothly transitions between volumetric- and surface-based rendering, greatly\naccelerating rendering speed and even improving visual fidelity. Our method\nconstructs an explicit mesh envelope which spatially bounds a neural volumetric\nrepresentation. In solid regions, the envelope nearly converges to a surface\nand can often be rendered with a single sample. To this end, we generalize the\nNeuS formulation with a learned spatially-varying kernel size which encodes the\nspread of the density, fitting a wide kernel to volume-like regions and a tight\nkernel to surface-like regions. We then extract an explicit mesh of a narrow\nband around the surface, with width determined by the kernel size, and\nfine-tune the radiance field within this band. At inference time, we cast rays\nagainst the mesh and evaluate the radiance field only within the enclosed\nregion, greatly reducing the number of samples required.

Second, while the visual\ninstruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue\nformat, the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns\nare weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To\ntackle these, we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types:\ncritique and refinement.

The refinement NLF offers concrete suggestions for improvement and\nis adopted to improve the interaction ability of the LVLMs-- which focuses on\nLVLMs' ability to refine responses by incorporating feedback in multi-turn\ninteractions.

In person re-ID, Jaccard distance\nis a widely used distance metric, especially in re-ranking and clustering\nscenarios. However, we discover that camera variation has a significant\nnegative impact on the reliability of Jaccard distance. In particular, Jaccard\ndistance calculates the distance based on the overlap of relevant neighbors.\nDue to camera variation, intra-camera samples dominate the relevant neighbors,\nwhich reduces the reliability of the neighbors by introducing intra-camera\nnegative samples and excluding inter-camera positive samples. To overcome this\nproblem, we propose a novel camera-aware Jaccard (CA-Jaccard) distance that\nleverages camera information to enhance the reliability of Jaccard distance.\nSpecifically, we introduce camera-aware k-reciprocal nearest neighbors (CKRNNs)\nto find k-reciprocal nearest neighbors on the intra-camera and inter-camera\nranking lists, which improves the reliability of relevant neighbors and\nguarantees the contribution of inter-camera samples in the overlap. Moreover,\nwe propose a camera-aware local query expansion (CLQE) to exploit camera\nvariation as a strong constraint to mine reliable samples in relevant neighbors\nand assign these samples higher weights in overlap to further improve the\nreliability. Our CA-Jaccard distance is simple yet effective and can serve as a\ngeneral distance metric for person re-ID methods with high reliability and low\ncomputational cost.

Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant\nframes and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose\ntokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model\nefficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster\n(TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic\ndiversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we\ndevelop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed\nspatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the\nnetwork output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast\ninference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and\nMPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and\nestimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models.

The proposed solution divides the images into\npatches and uses embedding-based multiple instance learning with a\nconvolutional neural network and an attention aggregation function for\nclassification. The implementation is evaluated on the Microsoft Malware\nClassification dataset and achieves accuracies of up to $96.6\\%$ on\nadversarially enlarged samples compared to the baseline of $22.8\\%$.

        "summary": "3D occupancy prediction is an important task for the robustness of\nvision-centric autonomous driving, which aims to predict whether each point is\noccupied in the surrounding 3D space. Existing methods usually require 3D\noccupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious\nto annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose\nSelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video\nsequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye\nview) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints\non the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can\nthen render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals\nto learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to\ndirectly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our\nSelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single\nframe as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that\nproduces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on Occ3D. SelfOcc\nproduces high-quality depth and achieves state-of-the-art results on novel\ndepth synthesis, monocular depth estimation, and surround-view depth estimation\non the SemanticKITTI, KITTI-2015, and nuScenes, respectively.

We hence\npropose WildFusion, a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent\ndiffusion models (LDMs). We first train an autoencoder that infers a compressed\nlatent representation, which additionally captures the images' underlying 3D\nstructure and enables not only reconstruction but also novel view synthesis.

        "summary": "Video-based large language models (Video-LLMs) have been recently introduced,\ntargeting both fundamental improvements in perception and comprehension, and a\ndiverse range of user inquiries. In pursuit of the ultimate goal of achieving\nartificial general intelligence, a truly intelligent Video-LLM model should not\nonly see and understand the surroundings, but also possess human-level\ncommonsense, and make well-informed decisions for the users. To guide the\ndevelopment of such a model, the establishment of a robust and comprehensive\nevaluation system becomes crucial. To this end, this paper proposes\n\\textit{Video-Bench}, a new comprehensive benchmark along with a toolkit\nspecifically designed for evaluating Video-LLMs. The benchmark comprises 10\nmeticulously crafted tasks, evaluating the capabilities of Video-LLMs across\nthree distinct levels: Video-exclusive Understanding, Prior Knowledge-based\nQuestion-Answering, and Comprehension and Decision-making. In addition, we\nintroduce an automatic toolkit tailored to process model outputs for various\ntasks, facilitating the calculation of metrics and generating convenient final\nscores. We evaluate 8 representative Video-LLMs using \\textit{Video-Bench}. The\nfindings reveal that current Video-LLMs still fall considerably short of\nachieving human-like comprehension and analysis of real-world videos, offering\nvaluable insights for future research directions.

We achieve\nthis by modulating the conditioning of the diffusion model using the output of\nthe discriminative model.

Our key insight is\nthat explicitly modeling contact between the human body surface and object\ngeometry can be used as strong proxy guidance, both during training and\ninference. Using this guidance to bridge human and object motion enables\ngenerating more realistic and physically plausible interaction sequences, where\nthe human body and corresponding object move in a coherent manner. Our method\nfirst learns to model human motion, object motion, and contact in a joint\ndiffusion process, inter-correlated through cross-attention. We then leverage\nthis learned contact for guidance during inference synthesis of realistic,\ncoherent HOIs. Extensive evaluation shows that our joint contact-based\nhuman-object interaction approach generates realistic and physically plausible\nsequences, and we show two applications highlighting the capabilities of our\nmethod.

        "summary": "Existing diffusion-based video editing models have made gorgeous advances for\nediting attributes of a source video over time but struggle to manipulate the\nmotion information while preserving the original protagonist's appearance and\nbackground. To address this, we propose MotionEditor, a diffusion model for\nvideo motion editing. MotionEditor incorporates a novel content-aware motion\nadapter into ControlNet to capture temporal motion correspondence. While\nControlNet enables direct generation based on skeleton poses, it encounters\nchallenges when modifying the source motion in the inverted noise due to\ncontradictory signals between the noise (source) and the condition (reference).\nOur adapter complements ControlNet by involving source content to transfer\nadapted control signals seamlessly. Further, we build up a two-branch\narchitecture (a reconstruction branch and an editing branch) with a\nhigh-fidelity attention injection mechanism facilitating branch interaction.\nThis mechanism enables the editing branch to query the key and value from the\nreconstruction branch in a decoupled manner, making the editing branch retain\nthe original background and protagonist appearance. We also propose a skeleton\nalignment algorithm to address the discrepancies in pose size and position.\nExperiments demonstrate the promising motion editing ability of MotionEditor,\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively.",

This\nstrategy offers two significant advantages. a) It allows us to take full\nadvantage of the recent advances in text-to-image models, such as Stable\nDiffusion, Midjourney, and DALLE, to generate photorealistic and highly\ndetailed images. b) Leveraging the generated image, the model can allocate less\nfocus to fine-grained appearance details, prioritizing the efficient learning\nof motion dynamics.

        "summary": "We present a method that uses a text-to-image model to generate consistent\ncontent across multiple image scales, enabling extreme semantic zooms into a\nscene, e.g., ranging from a wide-angle landscape view of a forest to a macro\nshot of an insect sitting on one of the tree branches. We achieve this through\na joint multi-scale diffusion sampling approach that encourages consistency\nacross different scales while preserving the integrity of each individual\nsampling process. Since each generated scale is guided by a different text\nprompt, our method enables deeper levels of zoom than traditional\nsuper-resolution methods that may struggle to create new contextual structure\nat vastly different scales. We compare our method qualitatively with\nalternative techniques in image super-resolution and outpainting, and show that\nour method is most effective at generating consistent multi-scale content.",

        "summary": "This paper enhances image-GPT (iGPT), one of the pioneering works that\nintroduce autoregressive pretraining to predict next pixels for visual\nrepresentation learning. Two simple yet essential changes are made. First, we\nshift the prediction target from raw pixels to semantic tokens, enabling a\nhigher-level understanding of visual content. Second, we supplement the\nautoregressive modeling by instructing the model to predict not only the next\ntokens but also the visible tokens. This pipeline is particularly effective\nwhen semantic tokens are encoded by discriminatively trained models, such as\nCLIP. We introduce this novel approach as D-iGPT. Extensive experiments\nshowcase that D-iGPT excels as a strong learner of visual representations: A\nnotable achievement of D-iGPT is its compelling performance on the ImageNet-1K\ndataset -- by training on publicly available datasets, D-iGPT achieves 89.5\\%\ntop-1 accuracy with a vanilla ViT-Large model. This model also shows strong\ngeneralization on the downstream task and robustness on out-of-distribution\nsamples.

In this work, we show that imitating\nshortest-path planners in simulation produces agents that, given a language\ninstruction, can proficiently navigate, explore, and manipulate objects in both\nsimulation and in the real world using only RGB sensors (no depth map or GPS\ncoordinates). This surprising result is enabled by our end-to-end,\ntransformer-based, SPOC architecture, powerful visual encoders paired with\nextensive image augmentation, and the dramatic scale and diversity of our\ntraining data: millions of frames of shortest-path-expert trajectories\ncollected inside approximately 200,000 procedurally generated houses containing\n40,000 unique 3D assets.

        "summary": "While there have been significant strides in dexterous manipulation, most of\nit is limited to benchmark tasks like in-hand reorientation which are of\nlimited utility in the real world. The main benefit of dexterous hands over\ntwo-fingered ones is their ability to pickup tools and other objects (including\nthin ones) and grasp them firmly to apply force. However, this task requires\nboth a complex understanding of functional affordances as well as precise\nlow-level control. While prior work obtains affordances from human data this\napproach doesn't scale to low-level control. Similarly, simulation training\ncannot give the robot an understanding of real-world semantics. In this paper,\nwe aim to combine the best of both worlds to accomplish functional grasping for\nin-the-wild objects. We use a modular approach. First, affordances are obtained\nby matching corresponding regions of different objects and then a low-level\npolicy trained in sim is run to grasp it. We propose a novel application of\neigengrasps to reduce the search space of RL using a small amount of human data\nand find that it leads to more stable and physically realistic motion. We find\nthat eigengrasp action space beats baselines in simulation and outperforms\nhardcoded grasping in real and matches or outperforms a trained human\nteleoperator.

This task\ntakes in image sets $D_A$ and $D_B$, and outputs a description that is more\noften true on $D_A$ than $D_B$. We outline a two-stage approach that first\nproposes candidate difference descriptions from image sets and then re-ranks\nthe candidates by checking how well they can differentiate the two sets. We\nintroduce VisDiff, which first captions the images and prompts a language model\nto propose candidate descriptions, then re-ranks these descriptions using CLIP.\nTo evaluate VisDiff, we collect VisDiffBench, a dataset with 187 paired image\nsets with ground truth difference descriptions. We apply VisDiff to various\ndomains, such as comparing datasets (e.g., ImageNet vs. ImageNetV2), comparing\nclassification models (e.g., zero-shot CLIP vs. supervised ResNet), summarizing\nmodel failure modes (supervised ResNet), characterizing differences between\ngenerative models (e.g., StableDiffusionV1 and V2), and discovering what makes\nimages memorable.
